<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="chaptsubhead">THE PROTESTANTS.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Where</span> changes are about to take place of great and enduring moment, a kind
of prologue, on a small scale, sometimes anticipates the true opening of
the drama; like the first drops which give notice of the coming storm, or
as if the shadows of the reality were projected forwards into the future,
and imitated in dumb show the movements of the real actors in the story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prelude to the Reformation in the fourteenth century.</div>

<p>Such a rehearsal of the English Reformation was witnessed at the close of
the fourteenth century, confused, imperfect, disproportioned, to outward
appearance barren of results; yet containing a representative of each one
of the mixed forces by which that great change was ultimately effected, and
foreshadowing even something of the course which it was to run.</p>

<p>There was a quarrel with the pope upon the extent of the papal privileges;
there were disputes between the laity and the clergy,&mdash;accompanied, as if
involuntarily, by attacks on the sacramental system and the Catholic
faith,&mdash;while innovation in doctrine was accompanied also with the tendency
which characterized the extreme development of the later
Protestants&mdash;towards political republicanism, the fifth monarchy, and
community of goods. Some account of this movement must be given in this
place, although it can be but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
sketch only. "Lollardry"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
has a history<span class="sidenote">The Lollards forerunners, not fathers, of the Reformation.</span>
of its own; but it forms no proper part of the history of the Reformation.
It was a separate phenomenon, provoked by the same causes which produced
their true fruit at a later period; but it formed no portion of the stem on
which those fruits ultimately grew. It was a prelude which was played out,
and sank into silence, answering for the time no other end than to make the
name of heretic odious in the ears of the English nation. In their recoil
from their first failure, the people stamped their hatred of heterodoxy
into their language; and in the word <i>miscreant</i>, misbeliever, as the
synonym of the worst species of reprobate, they left an indelible record of
the popular estimate of the followers of John Wycliffe.</p>

<p>The Lollard story opens with the disputes between the crown and the see of
Rome on the presentation to English benefices. For the hundred and fifty
years which succeeded the Conquest, the right of nominating the
archbishops, the bishops, and the mitred abbots, had been claimed and
exercised by the crown.<span class="sidenote">Changes in the mode of presentation to bishopricks.</span>
On the passing of the great charter, the church had
recovered its liberties, and the privilege of free election had been
conceded by a special clause to the clergy. The practice which then became
established was in accordance with the general spirit of the English
constitution. On the vacancy of a see, the cathedral chapter applied to the
crown for a cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire. The application was a form; the consent was
invariable. A bishop was then elected by a majority of suffrages; his name
was submitted to the metropolitan, and by him to the pope. If the pope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Right of free election conceded in the great charter to the
chapters and the religious houses.</span>
signified his approval, the election was complete; consecration followed;
and the bishop having been furnished with his bulls of investiture, was
presented to the king, and from him received "the temporalities" of his
see. The mode in which the great abbots were chosen was precisely similar;
the superiors of the orders to which the abbeys belonged were the channels
of communication with the pope, in the place of the archbishops; but the
elections in themselves were free, and were conducted in the same manner.
The smaller church benefices, the small monasteries or parish churches,
were in the hands of private patrons, lay or ecclesiastical; but in the
case of each institution a reference was admitted, or was supposed to be
admitted, to the court of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Privilege of the pope and of the superiors of the religious
orders in controlling the elections.</span>
There was thus in the pope's hand an authority of an indefinite kind, which
it was presumed that his sacred office would forbid him to abuse, but
which, however, if he so unfortunately pleased, he might abuse at his
discretion. He had absolute power over every nomination to an English
benefice; he might refuse his consent till such adequate reasons, material
or spiritual, as he considered sufficient to induce him to acquiesce, had
been submitted to his consideration. In the case of nominations to the
religious houses, the superiors of the various orders residing abroad had
equal facilities for obstructiveness; and the consequence of so large a
confidence in the purity of the higher orders of the Church became visible
<span class="sidenote"><small>A.D.</small> 1306-7.</span>
in an act of parliament which it was found necessary to pass in
1306-7.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
"Of late," says this act, "it has come to the knowledge of the king, by the
grievous complaint of the honourable persons, lords, and other noblemen of
<span class="sidenote">Act to prevent the superiors resident abroad from laying taxes
on the English houses.</span>
his realm, that whereas monasteries, priories, and other religious houses
were founded to the honour and glory of God, and the advancement of holy
church, by the king and his progenitors, and by the said noblemen and their
ancestors; and a very great portion of lands and tenements have been given
by them to the said monasteries, priories, and religious houses, and the
religious men serving God in them; to the intent that clerks and laymen
might be admitted in such houses, and that sick and feeble folk might be
maintained, hospitality, almsgiving, and other charitable deeds might be
done, and prayers be said for the souls of the founders and their heirs;
the abbots, priors, and governors of the said houses, <i>and certain aliens
their superiors</i>, as the abbots and priors of the Cistercians, the
Premonstrants, the orders of Saint Augustine and of Saint Benedict, and
many more of other religions and orders have at their own pleasure set
divers heavy, unwonted heavy and importable tallages, payments, and
impositions upon every of the said monasteries and houses subject unto
them, in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, without the privity of the
king and his nobility, contrary to the laws and customs of the said realm;
and thereby the number of religious persons being oppressed by such
tallages, payments, and impositions, the service of God is diminished, alms
are not given to the poor, the sick, and the feeble; the healths of the
living and the souls of the dead be miserably defrauded; hospitality,
almsgiving, and other godly deeds do cease; and so that which in times past
was charitably given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
to godly uses and to the service of God, is now
converted to an evil end, by permission whereof there groweth great scandal
to the people." To provide against a continuance of these abuses, it was
enacted that no "religious" persons should, under any pretence or form,
send out of the kingdom any kind of rent, tax, or tallage; and that "priors
aliens" should not presume to assess any payment, charge, or other burden
whatever upon houses within the
realm.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The language of this act was studiously guarded. The pope was not alluded
to; the specific methods by which the extortion was practised were not
explained; the tax upon presentations to benefices, either having not yet
distinguished itself beyond other impositions, or the government trusting
that a measure of this general kind might answer the desired end. Lucrative
encroachments, however, do not yield so easily to treatment; nearly fifty
years after it became necessary to re&euml;nact the same statute; and while
recapitulating the provisions of it, the parliament found it desirable to
point out more specifically the intention with which it was passed.</p>

<p>The popes in the interval had absorbed in their turn from the heads of the
religious orders, the privileges which by them had been extorted from the
affiliated societies. Each English benefice had become the fountain of a
rivulet which flowed into the Roman exchequer, or a property to be
distributed as the private patronage of the Roman bishop: and the English
parliament for the first time found itself in collision with the Father of
Christendom.</p>

<p>"The pope," says the fourth of the twenty-fifth of Edward III.,
"accroaching to himself the signories
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the benefices within the realm of
<span class="sidenote">Statute of provisors forbidding the attempts of the popes to
present to benefices in England.</span>
England, doth give and grant the same to aliens which did never dwell in
England, and to cardinals which could not dwell here, and to others as well
aliens as denizens, whereby manifold inconveniences have ensued." "Not
regarding" the statute of Edward I., he had also continued to present to
bishopricks, abbeys, priories, and other valuable preferments: money in
large quantities was carried out of the realm from the proceeds of these
offices, and it was necessary to insist emphatically that the papal
nominations should cease. They were made in violation of the law, and were
conducted with simony so flagrant that English benefices were sold in the
papal courts to any person who would pay for them, whether an Englishman or
a stranger. It was therefore decreed that the elections to bishopricks
should be free as in time past, that the rights of patrons should be
preserved, and penalties of imprisonment, forfeiture, or outlawry,
according to the complexion of the offence, should be attached to all
impetration of benefices from Rome by purchase or
otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The statute fails, and is again enacted in fresh forms.</div>

<p>If statute law could have touched the evil, these enactments would have
been sufficient for the purpose; but the influence of the popes in England
was of that subtle kind which was not so readily defeated. The law was
still defied, or still evaded; and the struggle continued till the close of
the century, the legislature labouring patiently, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
ineffectually, to confine with fresh enactments their ingenious
adversary.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The popes threaten the censures of the church.</div>

<p>At length symptoms appeared of an intention on the part of the popes to
maintain their claims with spiritual censures, and the nation was obliged
to resolve upon the course which, in the event of their resorting to that
extremity, it would follow. The lay
lords<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and the House of Commons found
no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion. They passed a fresh penal
statute with prohibitions even more emphatically stringent, and decided
<span class="sidenote">The parliament declares that to bring any such censures into the
realm shall be punished with death and forfeiture.</span>
that "if any man brought into this realm any sentence, summons, or
excommunication, contrary to the effect of the statute, he should incur
pain of life and members, with forfeiture of goods; and if any prelate made
execution of such sentence, his temporalities should be taken from him, and
should abide in the king's hands till redress was made."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>So bold a measure threatened nothing less than open rupture. The act,
however, seems to have been passed in haste, without determined
consideration; and on second thoughts, it was held more prudent to attempt
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
milder course. The strength of the opposition to the papacy lay with the
<span class="sidenote">A "great council" addresses the pope, with a desire for an
arrangement.</span>
Commons.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> When the session of parliament was over, a great council was
summoned to reconsider what should be done, and an address was drawn up,
and forwarded to Rome, with a request that the then reigning pope would
devise some manner by which the difficulty could be arranged.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Boniface
IX. replied with the same want of judgment which was shown afterwards on an
analogous occasion by Clement VII. He disbelieved the danger; and daring
the government to persevere, he granted a prebendal stall at Wells to an
Italian cardinal, to which a presentation had been made already by the
king. Opposing suits were instantly instituted between the claimants in the
courts of the two countries. A decision was given in England in favour of
<span class="sidenote">The question is brought to an issue by the excommunication of
the bishops.</span>
the nominee of the king, and the bishops agreeing to support the crown were
excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The court of Rome had resolved to try the issue by a
struggle of force, and the government had no alternative but to surrender
at discretion, or to persevere at all hazards, and resist the usurpation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><small>A.D.</small> 1392-3.</div>

<p>The proceedings on this occasion seem to have been unusual, and significant
of the importance of the crisis. Parliament either was sitting at the time
when the excommunication was issued, or else it was immediately assembled;
and the House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Commons drew up, in the form of a petition to the king, a
declaration of the circumstances which had occurred. After having stated
generally the English law on the presentation to benefices, "Now of late,"
they added, "divers processes be made by his Holiness the Pope, and
censures of excommunication upon certain bishops, because they have made
execution of the judgments [given in the king's courts], to the open
disherison of the crown; whereby, if remedy be not provided; the crown of
England, which hath been so free at all times, that it has been in no
earthly subjection, should be submitted to the pope; and the laws and
<span class="sidenote">The House of Commons declare that they will stand with the Crown
to live and die,</span>
statutes of the realm by him be defeated and avoided at his will, in
perpetual destruction of the sovereignty of the king our lord, his crown,
his regality, and all his realm." The Commons, therefore, on their part,
declared, "That the things so attempted were clearly against the king's
crown and his regality; used and approved or in the time of all his
progenitors, and therefore they and all the liege commons of the realm
would stand with their said lord the king, and his said crown, in the cases
aforesaid, to live and die."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Whether they made allusion to the act of
1389 does not appear,&mdash;a measure passed under protest from one of the
estates of the realm was possibly held unequal to meet the emergency,&mdash;at
<span class="sidenote">And desire the king to examine the lords spiritual and temporal
how they will stand.</span>
all events they would not rely upon it. For after this peremptory assertion
of their own opinion, they desired the king, "and required him in the way
of justice," to examine severally the lords spiritual and temporal how they
thought, and how they would stand.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The examination was made, and the
result was satisfactory. The lay lords replied without
<span class="sidenote">The lay lords answer directly, and the spiritual lords
indirectly, to the same effect with the Commons.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>reservation that
they would support the crown. The bishops (they were in a difficulty for
which all allowance must be made) gave a cautious, but also a manly answer.
They would not affirm, they said, that the pope had a right to
excommunicate them in such cases, and they would not say that he had not.
It was clear, however, that legal or illegal, such excommunication was
against the privileges of the English crown, and therefore that, on the
whole, they would and ought to be with the crown, <i>loialment</i>, like loyal
subjects, as they were bound by their allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In this unusual and emphatic manner, the three estates agreed that the pope
should be resisted; and an act passed "that all persons suing at the court
of Rome, and obtaining thence any bulls, instruments, sentences of
excommunication which touched the king, or were against him, his regality,
or his realm, and they which brought the same within the realm, or received
the same, or made thereof notification, or any other execution whatever,
within the realm or without, they, their notaries, procurators, maintainers
and abettors, fautors and counsellors, should be put out of the king's
protection, and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels, be
forfeited."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The pope yields.</div>

<p>The resolute attitude of the country terminated the struggle. Boniface
prudently yielded, and for the moment, and indeed for ever under this
especial form, the wave of papal encroachment was rolled back. The temper
which had been roused in the contest might perhaps have carried the nation
further. The liberties of the crown had been asserted successfully. The
analogous liberties of the church might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> have followed; and other channels,
too, might have been cut off, through which the papal exchequer fed itself
on English blood. But at this crisis the anti-Roman policy was arrested in
its course by another movement, which turned the current of suspicion, and
frightened back the nation to conservatism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogous agitation among the laity against the corruption of
the clergy.</div>

<p>While the crown and the parliament had been engaged with the pope, the
undulations of the dispute had penetrated down among the body of the
people, and an agitation had been commenced or an analogous kind against
the spiritual authorities at home. The parliament had lamented that the
duties of the religious houses were left unfulfilled, in consequence of the
extortions of their superiors abroad. The people, who were equally
convinced of the neglect of duty, adopted an interpretation of the
phenomenon less favourable to the clergy, and attributed it to the
temptations of worldliness, and the self-indulgence generated by enormous
wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Wycliffe.</div>

<p>This form of discontent found its exponent in John Wycliffe, the great
forerunner of the Reformation, whose austere figure stands out above the
crowd of notables in English history, with an outline not unlike that of
another forerunner of a greater change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His early career.</div>

<p>The early life of Wycliffe is obscure. Lewis, on the authority of
Leland,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> says that he was born near Richmond, in Yorkshire. Fuller,
though with some hesitation, prefers Durham.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He emerges into distinct
notice in 1360, ten years subsequent to the passing of the first Statute of
Provisors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> having then acquired a great Oxford reputation as a lecturer in
divinity, and having earned for himself powerful friends and powerful
enemies. He had made his name distinguished by attacks upon the clergy for
their indolence and profligacy: attacks both written and orally
delivered,&mdash;those, written, we observe, being written in English, not in
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In 1365, Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, appointed him Warden
of Canterbury Hall; the appointment, however, was made with some
irregularity, and the following year, Archbishop Islip dying, his
successor, Langham, deprived Wycliffe, and the sentence was confirmed by
the king. It seemed, nevertheless, that no personal reflection was intended
by this decision, for Edward III. nominated the ex-warden one of his
chaplains immediately after, and employed him on an important mission to
Bruges, where a conference on the benefice question was to be held with a
papal commission.</p>

<p>Other church preferment was subsequently given to Wycliffe; but Oxford
remained the chief scene of his work. He continued to hold his
professorship of divinity; and from this office the character of his
history took its complexion. At a time when books were rare and difficult
to be procured, lecturers who had truth to communicate fresh drawn from the
fountain, held an influence which in these days it is as difficult to
imagine as, however, it is impossible to overrate. Students from all Europe
flocked to the feet of a celebrated professor, who became the leader of a
party by the mere fact of his position.</p>

<p>The burden of Wycliffe's teaching was the exposure of the indolent fictions
which passed under the name of religion in the established theory of the
church. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was a man of most simple life; austere in appearance, with bare
feet and russet mantle.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Simplicity of his life and habits.</span>
As a soldier of Christ, he saw in his Great
Master and his Apostles the patterns whom he was bound to imitate. By the
contagion of example he gathered about him other men who thought as he did;
and gradually, under his captaincy, these "poor priests," as they were
called&mdash;vowed to poverty because Christ was poor&mdash;vowed to accept no
<span class="sidenote">The poor priests.</span>
benefice, lest they should misspend the property of the poor, and because,
as apostles, they were bound to go where their Master called
them,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<span class="sidenote">His doctrines.</span>
spread out over the country as an army of missionaries, to preach the faith
which they found in the Bible&mdash;to preach, not of relics and of indulgences,
but of repentance and of the grace of God. They carried with them copies of
<span class="sidenote">The translation of the Bible.</span>
the Bible which Wycliffe had translated, leaving here and there, as they
travelled, their costly treasures, as shining seed points of light; and
they refused to recognise the authority of the bishops, or their right to
silence them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is protected by John of Gaunt.</div>

<p>If this had been all, and perhaps if Edward III. had been succeeded by a
prince less miserably incapable than his grandson Richard, Wycliffe might
have made good his ground; the movement of the parliament against the pope
might have united in a common stream with the spiritual move against the
church at home, and the Reformation have been antedated by a century. He
was summoned to answer for himself before the Archbishop of Canterbury in
1377. He appeared in court supported by the presence of John of Gaunt, Duke
of Lancaster, the eldest of Edward's surviving sons, and the authori<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ties
were unable to strike him behind so powerful a shield.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory that the laity had a right to deprive the clergy of their
property.</div>

<p>But the "poor priests" had other doctrines besides those which they
discovered in the Bible, relating to subjects with which, as apostles, they
would have done better if they had shrunk from meddling. The inefficiency
of the clergy was occasioned, as Wycliffe thought, by their wealth and by
their luxury. He desired to save them from a temptation too heavy for them
to bear, and he insisted that by neglect of duty their wealth had been
forfeited, and that it was the business of the laity to take it from its
unworthy possessors. The invectives with which the argument was accompanied
produced a widely-spread irritation. The reins of the country fell
simultaneously into the weak hands of Richard II., and the consequence was
a rapid spread of disorder. In the year which followed Richard's accession,
consistory judges were assaulted in their courts, sanctuaries were
violated, priests were attacked and ill-treated in church, churchyard, and
cathedral, and even while engaged in the mass;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the contagion of the
growing anarchy seems to have touched even Wycliffe himself, and touched
him in a point most deeply dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tendencies to anabaptism.</div>

<p>His theory of property, and his study of the character of Christ, had led
him to the near confines of Anabaptism. Expanding his views upon the
estates of the church into an axiom, he taught that "charters of perpetual
<span class="sidenote">Theory of the tenure of property.</span>
inheritance were impossible;" "that God could not give men civil
possessions for ever;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
"that property was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
founded in grace, and
derived from God;" and "seeing that forfeiture was the punishment of
treason, and all sin was treason against God, the sinner must consequently
forfeit his right to what he held of God." These propositions were nakedly
true, as we shall most of us allow; but God has his own methods of
enforcing extreme principles; and human legislation may only meddle with
them at its peril. The theory as an abstraction could be represented as
<span class="sidenote">Wat Tyler's insurrection.</span>
applying equally to the laity as to the clergy, and the new teaching
received a practical comment in 1381, in the invasion of London by Wat, the
tyler of Dartford, and 100,000 men, who were to level all ranks, put down
the church, and establish universal liberty.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Two priests accompanied
the insurgents, not Wycliffe's followers, but the licentious counterfeits
of them, who trod inevitably in their footsteps, and were as inevitably
countenanced by their doctrines. The insurrection was attended with the
bloodshed, destruction, and ferocity natural to such outbreaks. The
Archbishop of Canterbury and many gentlemen were murdered; and a great part
of London sacked and burnt. It would be absurd to attribute this disaster
to Wycliffe, nor was there any desire to hold him responsible for it; but
<span class="sidenote">A mischievous comment on Wycliffe's teaching.</span>
it is equally certain that the doctrines which he had taught were
incompatible, at that particular time, with an effective repression of the
spirit which had caused the explosion. It is equally certain that he had
brought discredit on his nobler efforts by ambiguous language on a subject
of the utmost difficulty, and had taught the wiser and better portion of
the people to confound heterodoxy of opinion with sedition, anarchy, and
disorder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
So long as Wycliffe lived, his own lofty character was a guarantee for the
conduct of his immediate disciples; and although his favour had far
<span class="sidenote">Measure for the repression of the poor priests passed in the
House of Lords.</span>
declined, a party in the state remained attached to him, with sufficient
influence to prevent the adoption of extreme measures against the "poor
priests." In the year following the insurrection, an act was passed for
their repression in the House of Lords, and was sent down by the king to
the Commons. They were spoken of as "evil persons," going from place to
place in defiance of the bishops, preaching in the open air to great
congregations at markets and fairs, "exciting the people," "engendering
discord between the estates of the realm." The ordinaries had no power to
silence them, and had therefore desired that commissions should be issued
to the sheriffs of the various counties, to arrest all such persons, and
confine them, until they would "justify themselves" in the ecclesiastical
courts.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Rejected by the Commons at Wycliffe's petition.</span>
Wycliffe petitioned against the bill, and it was rejected; not
so much perhaps out of tenderness for the reformer, as because the Lower
House was excited by the controversy with the pope; and being doubtfully
disposed towards the clergy, was reluctant to subject the people to a more
stringent spiritual control.</p>

<p>But Wycliffe himself meanwhile had received a clear intimation of his own
declining position. His opposition to the church authorities, and his
efforts at reinvigorating the faith of the country, had led him into
doubtful statements on the nature of the eucharist; he had entangled
himself in dubious metaphysics on a subject on which no middle course is
really possible; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
being summoned to answer for his language before a
<span class="sidenote">Wycliffe's position, however, declines. He makes his
submission,</span>
synod in London, he had thrown himself again for protection on the Duke of
Lancaster. The duke (not unnaturally under the circumstances) declined to
encourage what he could neither approve nor understand;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and Wycliffe,
by his great patron's advice, submitted. He read a confession of faith
before the bishops, which was held satisfactory; he was forbidden, however,
<span class="sidenote">And dies Dec. 31, 1384.</span>
to preach again in Oxford, and retired to his living of Lutterworth, in
Leicestershire, where two years later he died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wycliffe's followers continue unmolested till the revolution of
1400 when they fall under the ban as disturbers of order.</div>

<p>With him departed all which was best and purest in the movement which he
had commenced. The zeal of his followers was not extinguished, but the
wisdom was extinguished which had directed it; and perhaps the being
treated as the enemies of order had itself a tendency to make them what
they were believed to be. They were left unmolested for the next twenty
years, the feebleness of the government, the angry complexion which had
been assumed by the dispute with Rome, and the political anarchy in the
closing decade of the century, combining to give them temporary shelter;
but they availed themselves of their opportunity to travel further on the
dangerous road on which they had entered; and on the settlement of the
country under Henry IV. they fell under the general ban which struck down
all parties who had shared in the late disturbances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><small>A.D.</small> 1400-1.</div>

<p>They had been spared in 1382, only for more sharp denunciation, and a more
cruel fate; and Boniface having healed, on his side, the wounds which had
been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
opened, by well-timed concessions, then, was no reason left for
leniency. The character of the Lollard teaching was thus described (perhaps
in somewhat exaggerated language) in the preamble of the act of 1401.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Act <i>de Heretico comburendo</i>.</div>

<p>"Divers false and perverse people," so runs the act <i>De Heretico
comburendo</i>, "of a certain new sect, damnably thinking of the faith of the
sacraments of the church, and of the authority of the same, against the law
of God and of the church, usurping the office of preaching, do perversely
and maliciously, in divers places within the realm, preach and teach divers
new doctrines, and wicked erroneous opinions, contrary to the faith and
<span class="sidenote">Political character of the teaching.</span>
determination of Holy Church. And of such sect and wicked doctrines they
make unlawful conventicles, they hold and exercise schools, they make and
write books, they do wickedly instruct and inform people, and excite and
stir them to sedition and insurrection, and make great strife and division
among the people, and other enormities horrible to be heard, daily do
perpetrate and commit. The diocesans cannot by their jurisdiction
spiritual, without aid of the King's Majesty, sufficiently correct these
said false and perverse people, nor refrain their malice, because they do
go from diocese to diocese, and will not appear before the said diocesans;
but the jurisdiction spiritual, the keys of the church, and the censures of
the same, do utterly contemn and despise; and so their wicked preachings
and doctrines they do from day to day continue and exercise, to the
destruction of all order and rule, right and reason."</p>

<p>Something of these violent accusations is perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
due to the horror with
which false doctrine in matters of faith was looked upon in the Catholic
church, the grace by which alone an honest life was made possible being
held to be dependent upon orthodoxy. But the Lollards had become political
revolutionists as well as religious reformers; the revolt against the
spiritual authority had encouraged and countenanced a revolt against the
secular; and we cannot be surprised, therefore, that these institutions
should have sympathized with each other, and have united to repress a
danger which was formidable to both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power conferred upon the bishops of arresting <i>ex officio</i>.</div>

<p>The bishops, by this act, received arbitrary power to arrest and imprison
on suspicion, without check or restraint of law, at their will and
pleasure. Prisoners who refused to abjure their errors, who persisted in
heresy, or relapsed into it after abjuration, were sentenced to be burnt at
the stake,&mdash;a dreadful punishment, on the wickedness of which the world has
long been happily agreed. Yet we must remember that those who condemned
<span class="sidenote">The stake and the orthodox faith.</span>
teachers of heresy to the flames, considered that heresy itself involved
everlasting perdition; that they were but faintly imitating the severity
which orthodoxy still ascribes to Almighty God Himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commons petition the Crown for a secularization of church
property.</div>

<p>The tide which was thus setting back in favour of the church did not yet,
however, flow freely, and without a check. The Commons consented to
sacrifice the heretics, but they still cast wistful looks on the lands of
the religious houses. On two several occasions, in 1406, and again 1410,
spoliation was debated in the Lower House, and representations were made
upon the subject to the king.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The country, too, continued to be agitated with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
war and treason; and when Henry V. became king, in 1412, the
<span class="sidenote">Accession of Henry V.</span>
church was still uneasy, and the Lollards were as dangerous as ever.
Whether by prudent conduct they might have secured a repeal of the
persecuting act is uncertain; it is more likely, from their conduct, that
they had made their existence incompatible with the security of any
tolerable government.</p>

<p>A rumour having gone abroad that the king intended to enforce the laws
against heresy, notices were found fixed against the doors of the London
churches, that if any such measure was attempted, a hundred thousand men
<span class="sidenote">Insurrection of Sir John Oldcastle.</span>
would be in arms to oppose it. These papers were traced to Sir John
Oldcastle, otherwise called Lord Cobham, a man whose true character is more
difficult to distinguish, in the conflict of the evidence which has come
down to us about him, than that of almost any noticeable person in history.
He was perhaps no worse than a fanatic. He was certainly prepared, if we
may trust the words of a royal proclamation (and Henry was personally
intimate with Oldcastle, and otherwise was not likely to have exaggerated
the charges against him), he was prepared to venture a rebellion, with the
prospect of himself becoming the president of some possible Lollard
commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The king, with swift decisiveness, annihilated the
incipient treason. Oldcastle was himself arrested. He escaped out of the
Tower into Scotland; and while Henry was absent in France he seems to have
attempted to organize some kind of Scotch invasion; but he was soon after
again taken on the Welsh Border, tried and executed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
An act which was
<span class="sidenote">Oldcastle tried and executed.</span>
passed in 1414 described his proceedings as an "attempt to destroy the
king, and all other manner of estates of the realm as well spiritual as
temporal, and also all manner of policy, and finally the laws of the land."
The sedition was held to have originated in heresy, and for the better
<span class="sidenote">Fresh act against heresy.</span>
repression of such mischiefs in time to come, the lord chancellor, the
judges, the justices of the peace, the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, and
every other officer having government of people, were sworn on entering
their office to use their best power and diligence to detect and prosecute
all persons suspected of so heinous a crime.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Final termination of the Lollard movement.</div>

<p>Thus perished Wycliffe's labour,&mdash;not wholly, because his translation of
the Bible still remained a rare treasure; a seed of future life, which
would spring again under happier circumstances. But the sect which he
organized, the special doctrines which he set himself to teach, after a
brief blaze of success, sank into darkness; and no trace remained of
Lollardry except the black memory of contempt and hatred with which the
heretics of the fourteenth century were remembered by the English people,
long after the actual Reformation had become the law of the land.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of Wycliffe's failure,</div>

<p>So poor a close to a movement of so fair promise was due partly to the
agitated temper of the times; partly, perhaps, to a want of judgment in
Wycliffe; but chiefly and essentially because it was an untimely birth.
Wycliffe saw the evil; he did not see the remedy; and neither in his mind
nor in the mind of the world about him had the problem ripened itself for
<span class="sidenote">Which is not to be regretted, for the times were not ripe.</span>
solution. England would have gained little by the premature overthrow of
the church, when the house out of which the evil spirit was cast out could
have been but swept and garnished for the occupation of the seven devils of
anarchy.</p>

<p>The fire of heresy continued to smoulder, exploding occasionally in
insurrection,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> occasionally blazing up in nobler form, when some poor
seeker for the truth, groping for a vision of God in the darkness of the
years which followed, found his way into that high presence through the
<span class="sidenote">The reaction.</span>
martyr's fire. But substantially, the nation relapsed into obedience,&mdash;the
church was reprieved for a century. Its fall was delayed till the spirit in
which it was attacked was winnowed clean of all doubtful elements&mdash;until
Protestantism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had recommenced its enterprise in a desire, not for a fairer
adjustment of the world's good things, but in a desire for some deeper,
truer, nobler, holier insight into the will of God. It recommenced not
<span class="sidenote">New birth of Protestantism.</span>
under the auspices of a Wycliffe, not with the partial countenance of a
government which was crossing swords with the Father of Catholic
Christendom, and menacing the severance of England from the unity of the
faith, but under a strong dynasty of undoubted Catholic loyalty, with the
entire administrative power, secular as well as spiritual, in the hands of
the episcopate. It sprung up spontaneously, unguided, unexcited, by the
vital necessity of its nature, among the masses of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association of Christian Brethren enrolled in London.</div>

<p>Leaping over a century, I pass to the year 1525, at which time, or about
which time, a society was enrolled in London calling itself "The
Association of Christian Brothers."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
It was composed of poor men,
chiefly tradesmen, artisans, a few, a very few of the clergy; but it was
carefully organized, it was provided with moderate funds, which were
regularly audited; and its paid agents went up and down the country
carrying Testaments and tracts with them, and enrolling in the order all
persons who dared to risk their lives in such a cause. The harvest had been
<span class="sidenote">Spirit of the country.</span>
long ripening. The records of the bishops' courts<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
are filled from the
beginning of the century with accounts of prosecutions for heresy&mdash;with
prosecutions, that is, of men and women to whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the masses, the
pilgrimages, the indulgences, the pardons, the effete paraphernalia of the
establishment, had become intolerable; who had risen up in blind
resistance, and had declared, with passionate anger, that whatever was the
truth, all this was falsehood. The bishops had not been idle; they had
plied their busy tasks with stake and prison, and victim after victim had
been executed with more than necessary cruelty. But it was all in vain:
punishment only multiplied offenders, and "the reek" of the martyrs, as was
said when Patrick Hamilton was burnt at St. Andrews, "infected all that it
did blow upon."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Absence of definite guidance.</div>

<p>There were no teachers, however, there were no books, no unity of
conviction, only a confused refusal to believe in lies. Copies of
Wycliffe's Bible remained, which parties here and there, under death
penalties if detected, met to read:<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
copies, also, of some of his
tracts<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
were extant; but they were unprinted transcripts, most rare and
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty from the want of books.</span>
precious, which the watchfulness of the police made it impossible to
multiply through the press, and which remained therefore necessarily in the
possession of but a few fortunate persons.</p>

<p>The Protestants were thus isolated in single groups or families, without
organization, without knowledge of each other, with nothing to give them
coherency as a party; and so they might have long continued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> except for an
impulse from some external circumstances. They were waiting for direction,
and men in such a temper are seldom left to wait in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General condition of the Teutonic nations.</div>

<p>The state of England did but represent the state of all Northern Europe.
Wherever the Teutonic language was spoken, wherever the Teutonic nature was
in the people, there was the same weariness of unreality, the same craving
for a higher life. England rather lagged behind than was a leader in the
race of discontent. In Germany, all classes shared the common feeling; in
England it was almost confined to the lowest. But, wherever it existed, it
was a free, spontaneous growth in each separate breast, not propagated by
agitation, but springing self-sown, the expression of the honest anger of
honest men at a system which had passed the limits of toleration, and which
could be endured no longer. At such times the minds of men are like a train
of gunpowder, the isolated grains of which have no relation to each other,
and no effect on each other, while they remain unignited; but let a spark
<span class="sidenote">The theses on the church-door at Wittenberg,</span>
kindle but one of them, and they shoot into instant union in a common
explosion. Such a spark was kindled in Germany, at Wittenberg, on the 31st
of October, 1517. In the middle of that day Luther's denunciation of
Indulgences was fixed against the gate of All Saints church, Wittenberg,
and it became, like the brazen serpent in the wilderness, the sign to which
the sick spirits throughout the western world looked hopefully and were
<span class="sidenote">And the kindling of Europe.</span>
healed. In all those millions of hearts the words of Luther found an echo,
and flew from lip to lip, from ear to ear. The thing which all were longing
for was done, and in two years from that day there was scarcely perhaps a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
village from the Irish Channel to the Danube in which the name of Luther
was not familiar as a word of hope and promise. Then rose a common cry for
guidance. Books were called for,&mdash;above all things, the great book of all,
the Bible. Luther's inexhaustible fecundity flowed with a steady stream,
and the printing-presses in Germany and in the Free Towns of the
Netherlands multiplied Testaments and tracts in hundreds of thousands.
Printers published at their own expense as Luther wrote.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The continent was covered with disfrocked monks who had become the pedlars of these
precious wares;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
and as the contagion spread, noble young spirits from
other countries, eager themselves to fight in God's battle, came to
<span class="sidenote">The gathering under the banner of the Cross.</span>
Wittenberg to learn from the champion who had struck the first blow at
their great enemy how to use their weapons. "Students from all nations came
to Wittenberg," says one, "to hear Luther and Melancthon. As they came in
sight of the town they returned thanks to God with clasped hands; for from
Wittenberg, as heretofore from Jerusalem, proceeded the light of
evangelical truth, to spread thence to the utmost parts of the
earth."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Thither came young Patrick Hamilton from Edinburgh, whose "reek" was of so
<span class="sidenote">Tyndal's first appearance and character.</span>
much potency, a boy-enthusiast of nature as illustrious as his birth; and
thither came also from England, which is here our chief concern, William
Tyndal, a man whose history is lost in his work and whose epitaph is the
Reformation. Beginning life as a restless Oxford student, he moved thence
to Cambridge, thence to Gloucestershire, to be tutor in a knight's family,
and there hearing of Luther's doings, and expressing himself with too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> warm
approval to suit his patron's conservatism,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he fell into disgrace. From
Gloucestershire he removed to London, where Cuthbert Tunstall had lately
been made bishop, and from whom he looked for countenance in an intention
to translate the New Testament. Tunstall showed little encouragement to
this enterprise; but a better friend rose where he was least looked for;
and a London alderman, Humfrey Monmouth by name, hearing the young dreamer
preach on some occasion at St. Dunstan's, took him to his home for half a
year, and kept him there: where "the said Tyndal," as the alderman
declared, "lived like a good priest, studying both night and day; he would
eat but sodden meat, by his good will, nor drink but small single beer; nor
was he ever seen to wear linen about him all the time of his being
there."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The half year being passed, Monmouth gave him ten pounds, with
which provision he went off to Wittenberg; and the alderman, for assisting
him in that business, went to the Tower&mdash;escaping, however, we are glad to
know, without worse consequences than a short imprisonment. Tyndal saw
Luther,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
<span class="sidenote">The translation of the Bible, and the press at Antwerp.</span>
and under his immediate direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> translated the Gospels and
Epistles while at Wittenberg. Thence he returned to Antwerp, and settling
there under the privileges of the city, he was joined by Joy, who shared
his great work with him. Young Frith from Cambridge came to him also, and
Barnes, and Lambert, and many others of whom no written record remains, to
concert a common scheme of action.</p>

<p>In Antwerp, under the care of these men, was established the
printing-press, by which books were supplied, to accomplish for the
teaching of England what Luther and Melancthon were accomplishing for
Germany. Tyndal's Testament was first printed, then translations of the
best German books, reprints of Wycliffe's tracts or original commentaries.
Such volumes as the people most required were here multiplied as fast as
the press could produce them; and for the dissemination of these precious
writings the brave London Protestants dared, at the hazard of their lives,
to form themselves into an organized association.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The London Protestants.</div>

<p>It is well to pause and look for a moment at this small band of heroes; for
heroes they were, if ever men deserved the name. Unlike the first reformers
who had followed Wycliffe, they had no earthly object, emphatically none;
and equally unlike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
them, perhaps, because they had no earthly object, they
were all, as I have said, poor men&mdash;either students, like Tyndal, or
artisans and labourers who worked for their own bread, and in tough contact
with reality had learnt better than the great and the educated the
difference between truth and lies. Wycliffe had royal dukes and noblemen
for his supporters&mdash;knights and divines among his disciples&mdash;a king and a
House of Commons looking upon him, not without favour. The first
Protestants of the sixteenth century had for their king the champion of
Holy Church, who had broken a lance with Luther; and spiritual rulers over
them alike powerful and imbecile, whose highest conception of Christian
virtue was the destruction of those who disobeyed their mandates. The
masses of the people were indifferent to a cause which promised them no
material advantage; and the Commons of Parliament, while contending with
the abuses of the spiritual authorities, were laboriously anxious to wash
their hands of heterodoxy. "In the crime of heresy, thanked be God," said
the bishops in 1529, "there hath no notable person fallen in our time;" no
chief priest, chief ruler, or learned Pharisee&mdash;not one. "Truth it is that
certain apostate friars and monks, lewd priests, bankrupt merchants,
vagabonds and lewd idle fellows of corrupt nature, have embraced the
abominable and erroneous opinions lately sprung in Germany, and by them
have been some seduced in simplicity and ignorance. Against these, if
judgment have been exercised according to the laws of the realm, we be
without blame. If we have been too remiss or slack, we shall gladly do our
duty from henceforth."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Such were the first Protestants in the eyes of
their superiors. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">The opposing powers.</span>
one side was wealth, rank, dignity, the weight of
authority, the majority of numbers, the prestige of centuries; here too
were the phantom legions of superstition and cowardice; and here were all
the worthier influences so pre&euml;minently English, which lead wise men to
shrink from change, and to cling to things established, so long as one
stone of them remains upon another. This was the army of conservatism.
Opposed to it were a little band of enthusiasts, armed only with truth and
fearlessness; "weak things of the world," about to do battle in God's name;
<span class="sidenote">The Protestant armoury.</span>
and it was to be seen whether God or the world was the stronger. They were
armed, I say, with the truth. It was that alone which could have given them
victory in so unequal a struggle. They had returned to the essential
fountain of life; they reasserted the principle which has lain at the root
of all religions, whatever their name or outward form, which once burnt
with divine lustre in that Catholicism which was now to pass away: the
fundamental axiom of all real life, that the service which man owes to God
is not the service of words or magic forms, or ceremonies or opinions; but
the service of holiness, of purity, of obedience to the everlasting laws of
duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The early Protestants did not bring forward any new scheme of
doctrine,</div>

<p>When we look through the writings of Latimer, the apostle of the English
Reformation, when we read the depositions against the martyrs, and the
lists of their crimes against the established faith, we find no opposite
schemes of doctrine, no "plans of salvation;" no positive system of
theology which it was held a duty to believe; these things were of later
growth, when it became again necessary to clothe the living spirit in a
perishable body. We find only an effort to express again the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">But protested only against a false superstition, and insisted on
the principle of obedience.</span>old
exhortation of the Wise Man&mdash;"Will you hear the beginning and the end of
the whole matter? Fear God and keep his commandments; for that is the whole
duty of man."</p>

<p>Had it been possible for mankind to sustain themselves upon this single
principle without disguising its simplicity, their history would have been
painted in far other colours than those which have so long chequered its
surface. This, however, has not been given to us; and perhaps it never will
be given. As the soul is clothed in flesh, and only thus is able to perform
its functions in this earth, where it is sent to live; as the thought must
find a word before it can pass from mind to mind; so every great truth
seeks some body, some outward form in which to exhibit its powers. It
appears in the world, and men lay hold of it, and represent it to
themselves, in histories, in forms of words, in sacramental symbols; and
these things which in their proper nature are but illustrations, stiffen
into essential fact, and become part of the reality. So arises in era after
era an outward and mortal expression of the inward immortal life; and at
once the old struggle begins to repeat itself between the flesh and the
spirit, the form and the reality. For a while the lower tendencies are held
in check; the meaning of the symbolism is remembered and fresh; it is a
living language, pregnant and suggestive. By and bye, as the mind passes
into other phases, the meaning is forgotten; the language becomes a dead
language; and the living robe of life becomes a winding-sheet of
corruption. The form is represented as everything, the spirit as nothing;
obedience is dispensed with; sin and religion arrange a compromise; and
outward observances, or technical inward emotions, are converted into
jugglers' tricks, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
which men are enabled to enjoy their pleasures and
escape the penalties of wrong. Then such religion becomes no religion, but
a falsehood; and honourable men turn away from it, and fall back in haste
upon the naked elemental life.</p>

<p>This, as I understand it, was the position of the early Protestants. They
found the service of God buried in a system where obedience was dissipated
into superstition; where sin was expiated by the vicarious virtues of other
men; where, instead of leading a holy life, men were taught that their
souls might be saved through masses said for them, at a money rate, by
priests whose licentiousness disgraced the nation which endured it; a
<span class="sidenote">The last form of the corruption of Catholicism.</span>
system in which, amidst all the trickery of the pardons, pilgrimages,
indulgences,&mdash;double-faced as these inventions are, wearing one meaning in
the apologies of theologians, and quite another to the multitude who live
and suffer under their influence,&mdash;one plain fact at least is visible. The
people substantially learnt that all evils which could touch either their
spirits or their bodies might be escaped by means which resolved
themselves, scarcely disguised, into the payment of moneys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestants turn to the Bible and to the life of Christ.</div>

<p>The superstition had lingered long; the time had come when it was to pass
away. Those in whom some craving lingered for a Christian life turned to
the heart of the matter, to the book which told them who Christ was, and
what he was; and finding there that holy example for which they longed,
they flung aside in one noble burst of enthusiastic passion the disguise
which had concealed it from them. They believed in Christ, not in the
bowing rood, or the pretended wood of the cross on which he suffered; and
when that saintly figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> had once been seen,&mdash;the object of all love, the
pattern of all imitation,&mdash;thenceforward neither form nor ceremony should
stand between them and their God.</p>

<p>Under much confusion of words and thoughts, confusion pardonable in all
men, and most of all in them, this seems to me to be transparently visible
in the aim of these "Christian Brothers"; a thirst for some fresh and noble
<span class="sidenote">The dangers which they had to encounter.</span>
enunciation of the everlasting truth, the one essential thing for all men
to know and believe. And therefore they were strong; and therefore they at
last conquered. Yet if we think of it, no common daring was required in
those who would stand out at such a time in defence of such a cause. The
bishops might seize them on mere suspicion; and the evidence of the most
abandoned villains sufficed for their conviction.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
By the act of Henry V., every officer, from the lord chancellor to the parish constable, was
sworn to seek them out and destroy them; and both bishops and officials had
shown no reluctance to execute their duty. Hunted like wild beasts from
hiding-place to hiding-place, decimated by the stake, with the certainty
that however many years they might be reprieved, their own lives would
close at last in the same fiery trial; beset by informers, imprisoned,
racked, and scourged; worst of all, haunted by their own infirmities, the
flesh shrinking before the dread of a death of agony,&mdash;thus it was that
<span class="sidenote">Henry VIII. their only and very doubtful friend.</span>
they struggled on; earning for <i>themselves</i> martyrdom,&mdash;for <i>us</i>, the free
England in which we live and breathe. Among the great, until Cromwell came
to power, they had but one friend, and he but a doubtful one, who long
believed the truest kindness was to kill them. Henry VIII. was always
attracted towards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
persons of the reformers. Their open bearing
commanded his respect. Their worst crime in the bishops' eyes&mdash;the
translating the Bible&mdash;was in his eyes not a crime, but a merit; he had
himself long desired an authorized English version, and at length compelled
the clergy to undertake it; while in the most notorious of the men
themselves, in Tyndal and in Frith, he had more than once expressed an
anxious interest.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But the convictions of his early years were long in
yielding. His feeling, though genuine, extended no further than to pity, to
a desire to recover estimable heretics out of errors which he would
endeavour to pardon. They knew, and all the "brethren" knew, that if they
persisted, they must look for the worst from the king and from every
earthly power; they knew it, and they made their account with it. An
informer deposed to the council, that he had asked one of the society "how
the King's Grace did take the matter against the sacrament; which answered,
the King's Highness was extreme against their opinions, and would punish
<span class="sidenote">Two thousand books out against transubstantiation.</span>
them grievously; also that my Lords of Norfolk and Suffolk, my Lord Marquis
of Exeter, with divers other great lords, were very extreme against them.
Then he (the informer) asked him how he and his fellows would do seeing
this, the which answered they had two thousand books out against the
Blessed Sacrament, in the commons' hands; and if it were once in the
commons' heads, they would have no further care."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution to persecute systematically.</div>

<p>Tyndal then being at work at Antwerp, and the society for the dispersion of
his books thus preparing itself in England, the authorities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> were not slow
in taking the alarm. The isolated discontent which had prevailed hitherto
had been left to the ordinary tribunals; the present danger called for
measures of more systematic coercion. This duty naturally devolved on
Wolsey, and the office of Grand Inquisitor, which he now assumed, could not
have fallen into more competent hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conduct of the persecution undertaken by Wolsey; who,
however, used his powers with unusual leniency.</div>

<p>Wolsey was not cruel. There is no instance, I believe, in which he of his
special motion sent a victim to the stake:&mdash;it would be well if the same
praise could be allowed to Cranmer. There was this difference between the
cardinal and other bishops, that while they seemed to desire to punish,
Wolsey was contented to silence; while they, in their conduct of trials,
made escape as difficult as possible, Wolsey sought rather to make
submission easy. He was too wise to suppose that he could cauterize heresy,
while the causes of it, in the corruption of the clergy, remained
unremoved; and the remedy to which he trusted, was the infusing new vigour
into the constitution of the church.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Nevertheless, he was determined to
repress, as far as outward measures could repress it, the spread of the
contagion; and he set himself to accomplish his task with the full energy
of his nature, backed by the whole power, spiritual and secular, of the
kingdom. The country was covered with his secret police, arresting
suspected persons and searching for books. In London the scrutiny was so
strict that at one time there was a general flight and panic; suspected
butchers, tailors, and carpenters, hiding themselves in the holds of
vessels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in the river, and escaping across the Channel.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Heretics outlawed by a common consent of the great Powers.</span>
Even there they
were not safe. Heretics were outlawed by a common consent of the European
governments. Special offenders were hunted through France by the English
emissaries with the permission and countenance of the
court,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and there
was an attempt to arrest Tyndal at Brussels, from which, for that time, he
happily escaped.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Barnes and Latimer summoned before Wolsey.</div>

<p>Simultaneously the English universities fell under examination, in
consequence of the appearance of dangerous symptoms among the younger
students. Dr. Barnes, returning from the continent, had used violent
language in a pulpit at Cambridge; and Latimer, then a neophyte in heresy,
had grown suspect, and had alarmed the heads of houses. Complaints against
both of them were forwarded to Wolsey, and they were summoned to London to
answer for themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latimer is dismissed.</div>

<p>Latimer, for some cause, found favour with the cardinal, and was dismissed,
with a hope on the part of his judge that his accusers might prove as
honest as he appeared to be, and even with a general licence to
preach.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Barnes was less fortunate; he was far inferior to Latimer; a noisy, unwise
man, without reticence or prudence. In addition to his offences in matters
of doctrine, he had attacked Wolsey himself with somewhat vulgar
personality; and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was thought well to single him out for a public,
though not a very terrible admonition. His house had been searched for
books, which he was suspected, and justly suspected, of having brought with
him from abroad. These, however, through a timely warning of the danger,
had been happily
secreted,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
or it might have gone harder with him. As it
<span class="sidenote">Barnes is committed to the Fleet and abjures.</span>
was, he was committed to the Fleet on the charge of having used heretical
language. An abjuration was drawn up by Wolsey, which he signed; and while
he remained in prison preparations were made for a ceremony, in which he
was to bear a part, in St. Paul's church, by which the Catholic authorities
hoped to produce some salutary effect on the disaffected spirits of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparation for a ceremony in St. Paul's church.</div>

<p>Vast quantities of Tyndal's publications had been collected by the police.
The bishops, also, had subscribed among themselves<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to buy up the copies
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> New Testament before they left Antwerp;&mdash;an unpromising method,
like an attempt to extinguish fire by pouring oil upon it; they had been
successful, however, in obtaining a large immediate harvest, and a pyramid
of offending volumes was ready to be consumed in a solemn <i>auto da f&eacute;</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Procession from the Fleet.</div>

<p>In the morning of Shrove Sunday, then, 1527, we are to picture to ourselves
a procession moving along London streets from the Fleet prison to St.
Paul's Cathedral. The warden of the Fleet was there, and the knight
marshal, and the tipstaffs, and "all the company they could make," "with
bills and glaives;" and in the midst of these armed officials, six men
marching in penitential dresses, one carrying a lighted taper five pounds'
weight, the others with symbolic fagots, signifying to the lookers-on the
<span class="sidenote">Barnes and five Stillyard men taken to St. Paul's.</span>
fate which their crimes had earned for them, but which this time, in mercy,
was remitted. One of these was Barnes; the other five were "Stillyard men,"
undistinguishable by any other name, but detected members of the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when they arrived at St. Paul's. The people had
flocked in crowds before them. The public seats and benches were filled.
All London had hurried to the spectacle. A platform was erected in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> the
centre of the nave, on the top of which, enthroned in pomp of purple and
gold and splendour, sate the great cardinal, supported on each side with
eighteen bishops, mitred abbots, and priors&mdash;six-and-thirty in all; his
chaplains and "spiritual doctors" sitting also where they could find place,
"in gowns of damask and satin." Opposite the platform, over the north door
of the cathedral, was a great crucifix&mdash;a famous image, in those days
called the Rood of Northen; and at the foot of it, inside a rail, a fire
was burning, with the sinful books, the Tracts and Testaments, ranged round
it in baskets, waiting for the execution of sentence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And exposed for a public penance.</div>

<p>Such was the scene into the midst of which the six prisoners entered. A
second platform stood in a conspicuous place in front of the cardinal's
throne, where they could be seen and heard by the crowd; and there upon
their knees, with their fagots on their shoulders, they begged pardon of
God and the Holy Catholic Church for their high crimes and offences. When
the confession was finished, Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, preached a
sermon: and the sermon over, Barnes turned to the people, declaring that
"he was more charitably handled than he deserved, his heresies were so
heinous and detestable."</p>

<div class="sidenote">They are led round a fire, and throw in their fagots. The Bible
burning.</div>

<p>There was no other religious service: mass had perhaps been said previous
to the admission into the church of heretics lying under censure; and the
knight marshal led the prisoners down from the stage to the fire underneath
the crucifix. They were taken within the rails, and three times led round
the blazing pile, casting in their fagots as they passed. The contents of
the baskets were heaped upon the fagots, and the holocaust was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> complete.
This time, an unbloody sacrifice was deemed sufficient. The church was
satisfied with penance, and Fisher pronounced the prisoners absolved, and
received back into communion.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>So ended this strange exhibition, designed to work great results on the
consciences of the spectators. It may be supposed, however, that men whom
the tragedies of Smithfield failed to terrify, were not likely to be
affected deeply by melodrame and blazing paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of Anthony Dalaber.</div>

<p>A story follows of far deeper human interest, a story in which the
persecution is mirrored with its true lights and shadows, unexaggerated by
rhetoric; and which, in its minute simplicity, brings us face to face with
that old world, where men like ourselves lived, and worked, and suffered,
three centuries ago.</p>

<p>Two years before the time at which we have now arrived, Wolsey, in
pursuance of his scheme of converting the endowments of the religious
houses to purposes of education, had obtained permission from the pope to
suppress a number of the smaller monasteries. He had added largely to the
means thus placed at his disposal from his own resources, and had founded
<span class="sidenote">Cardinal's College founded by Wolsey,</span>
the great college at Oxford, which is now called Christ
church.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Desiring his magnificent institution to be as perfect as art could make it,
he had sought his professors in Rome, in the Italian universities, wherever
genius or ability could be found; and he had introduced into the foundation
several students
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
from Cambridge, who had been reported to him as being of
unusual promise. Frith, of whom we have heard, was one of these. Of the
<span class="sidenote">Who introduces into Oxford a number of Cambridge students of
unusual promise, but lying under suspicion of heresy.</span>
rest, John Clark, Sumner, and Taverner are the most noticeable. At the time
at which they were invited to Oxford, they were tainted, or some of them
were tainted, in the eyes of the Cambridge authorities, with suspicion of
heterodoxy;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and it is creditable to Wolsey's liberality, that he set
aside these unsubstantiated rumours, not allowing them to weigh against
ability, industry, and character. The church authorities thought only of
crushing what opposed them, especially of crushing talent, because talent
was dangerous. Wolsey's noble anxiety was to court talent, and if possible
to win it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They infect Oxford; and the first Protestant divinity class is
formed at Wolsey's college.</div>

<p>The young Cambridge students, however, ill repaid his confidence (so, at
least, it must have appeared to him), and introduced into Oxford the rising
epidemic. Clark, as was at last discovered, was in the habit of reading St.
Paul's Epistles to young men in his rooms; and a gradually increasing
circle of undergraduates, of three or four years' standing,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> from
various colleges, formed themselves into a spiritual freemasonry, some of
them passionately insisting on being admitted to the lectures, in spite of
warnings from Clark himself, whose wiser foresight knew the risk which they
were running,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> and shrank from allowing weak giddy spirits to thrust
themselves into so fearful peril.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Garret, fellow of Magdalen, and member of the London Society,</div>

<p>This little party had been in the habit of meeting for about six
months,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> when at Easter, 1527, Thomas Garret, a fellow of Magdalen,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
who had gone out of residence, and was curate at All Hallows church, in
London, reappeared in Oxford. Garret was a secret member of the London
Society, and had come down at Clark's instigation, to feel his way in the
university. So excellent a beginning had already been made, that he had
only to improve upon it. He sought out all such young men as were given to
Greek, Hebrew, and the polite Latin;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Introduces into Oxford the forbidden books from Germany.</span>
and in this visit met with so much
encouragement, that the Christmas following he returned again, this time
bringing with him treasures of forbidden books, imported by "the Christian
Brothers"; New Testaments, tracts and volumes of German divinity, which he
sold privately among the initiated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Orders for his arrest are sent down from London.</div>

<p>He lay concealed, with his store, at "the house of one Radley,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the
position of which cannot now be identified; and there he remained for
several weeks, unsuspected by the university authorities, till orders were
sent by Wolsey to the Dean of Christchurch for his arrest. Precise
information was furnished at the same time respecting him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>self, his mission
in Oxford, and his place of concealment.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuesday, Feb. 17, 1528. He is warned by a proctor to escape.</div>

<p>The proctors were put upon the scent, and directed to take him; but one of
them, Arthur Cole, of Magdalen, by name, not from any sympathy with
Garret's objects, as the sequel proved, but probably from old acquaintance,
for they were fellows at the same college, gave him information of his
danger, and warned him to escape.</p>

<p>His young friends, more alarmed for their companion than for themselves,
held a meeting instantly to decide what should be done; and at this meeting
was Anthony Dalaber, an undergraduate of Alban Hall, and one of Clark's
pupils, who will now tell the story of what followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dalaber's narrative.</div>

<p>"The Christmas before that time, I, Anthony Dalaber, the scholar of Alban
Hall, who had books of Master Garret, had been in my country, at
Dorsetshire, at Stalbridge, where I had a brother, parson of this parish,
who was very desirous to have a curate out of Oxford, and willed me in any
wise to get him one there, if I could. This just occasion offered, it was
thought good among the brethren (for so we did not only call one another,
but were indeed one to another), that Master Garret, changing his name,
should be sent forth with my letters into Dorsetshire, to my brother, to
serve him there for a time, until he might secretly convey himself from
thence some whither over the sea. According hereunto I wrote my letters in
all haste possible unto my brother, for Master Garret to be his curate; but
not declaring what he was indeed, for my brother was a rank papist, and
afterwards was the most mortal enemy that ever I had, for the Gospel's
sake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb. 18. Garret leaves Oxford.</div>

<p>"So on Wednesday (Feb. 18), in the morning before Shrovetide, Master
Garret departed out of Oxford towards Dorsetshire, with my letter, for his
new service."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anthony Dalaber, of Alban Hall, who has been concerned in the
escape, takes measures to avoid suspicion,</div>

<p>The most important person being thus, as was supposed, safe from immediate
danger, Dalaber was at leisure to think a little about himself; and
supposing, naturally, that the matter would not end there, and that some
change of residence might be of advantage for his own security, he moved
off from Alban Hall (as undergraduates it seems were then at liberty to do)
to Gloucester College,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> under pretence that he desired to study civil
law, for which no facilities existed at the hall. This little matter was
<span class="sidenote">And moves to Gloucester College.</span>
effected on the Thursday; and all Friday and Saturday morning he "was so
much busied in setting his poor stuff in order, his bed, his books, and
such things else as he had," that he had no leisure to go forth anywhere
those two days, Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>"Having set up my things handsomely," he continues, "that same day, before
noon, I determined to spend that whole afternoon, until evensong time, at
Frideswide College,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> at my book in mine own study; and so shut my
chamber door unto me, and my study door also, and took into my head to read
Francis Lambert upon the Gospel of St. Luke, which book only I had then
within there. All my other books written on the Scriptures, of which I had
great numbers, I had left in my chamber at Alban's Hall, where I had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a very secret place to keep them safe in, because it was so dangerous to
have any such books. And so, as I was diligently reading in the same book
of Lambert upon Luke, suddenly one knocked at my chamber door very hard,
which made me astonished, and yet I sat still and would not speak; then he
knocked again more hard, and yet I held my peace; and straightway he
<span class="sidenote">Garret returns to Oxford, Friday, Feb. 20.</span>
knocked again yet more fiercely; and then I thought this: peradventure it
is somebody that hath need of me: and therefore I thought myself bound to
do as I would be done unto; and so, laying my book aside, I came to the
door and opened it, and there was Master Garret, as a man amazed, whom I
thought to have been with my brother, and one with him."</p>

<p>Garret had set out on his expedition into Dorsetshire, but had been
frightened, and had stolen back into Oxford on the Friday, to his old
hiding-place, where, in the middle of the night, the proctors had taken
<span class="sidenote">He is taken, and shut up at Lincoln.</span>
him. He had been carried to Lincoln, and shut up in a room in the rector's
house, where he had been left all day. In the afternoon the rector went to
chapel, no one was stirring about the college, and he had taken advantage
of the opportunity to slip the bolt of the door and escape. He had a friend
at Gloucester College, "a monk who had bought books of him;" and Gloucester
<span class="sidenote">From whence he escapes, Saturday, Feb. 21,</span>
lying on the outskirts of the town, he had hurried down there as the
readiest place of shelter. The monk was out; and as no time was to be lost,
Garret asked the servant on the staircase to show him Dalaber's rooms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And goes to Dalaber's rooms.</div>

<p>As soon as the door was opened, "he said he was undone, for he was taken."
"Thus he spake unad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>visedly in the presence of the young man, who at once
slipped down the stairs," it was to be feared, on no good errand. "Then I
said to him," Dalaber goes on, "alas, Master Garret, by this your
uncircumspect coming here and speaking so before the young man, you have
disclosed yourself and utterly undone me. I asked him why he was not in
Dorsetshire. He said he had gone a day's journey and a half; but he was so
fearful, his heart would none other but that he must needs return again
unto Oxford. With deep sighs and plenty of tears, he prayed me to help to
convey him away; and so he cast off his hood and gown wherein he came to
me, and desired me to give him a coat with sleeves, if I had any; and he
told me that he would go into Wales, and thence convey himself, if he
might, into Germany. Then I put on him a sleeved coat of mine. He would
also have had another manner of cap of me, but I had none but priestlike,
such as his own was.</p>

<p>"Then kneeled we both down together upon our knees, and lifting up our
hearts and hands to God our heavenly Father, desired him, with plenty of
tears, so to conduct and prosper him in his journey, that he might well
escape the danger of all his enemies, to the glory of His Holy Name, if His
good pleasure and will so were. And then we embraced and kissed the one the
<span class="sidenote">Dalaber lends him a disguise, and he again leaves Oxford.</span>
other, the tears so abundantly flowing out from both our eyes, that we all
bewet both our faces, and scarcely for sorrow could we speak one to
another. And so he departed from me, apparelled in my coat, being committed
unto the tuition of our Almighty and merciful Father.</p>

<p>"When he was gone down the stairs from my chamber, I straightways did shut
my chamber door, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> went into my study; and taking the New Testament in
my hands, kneeled down on my knees, and with many a deep sigh and salt
tear, I did, with much deliberation, read over the tenth chapter of St.
Matthew's Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> praying that God would endue his tender and
lately-born little flock in Oxford with heavenly strength by his Holy
Spirit; that quietly to their own salvation, with all godly patience, they
might bear Christ's heavy cross, which I now saw was presently to be laid
on their young and weak backs, unable to bear so huge a burden without the
great help of his Holy Spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dalaber goes to Frideswide.</div>

<p>"This done, I laid aside my book safe, folded up Master Garret's gown and
hood, and so, having put on my short gown, and shut my doors, I went
towards Frideswide (Christchurch), to speak with that worthy martyr of God,
Master Clark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> But of purpose I went by St. Mary's church, to go first unto
Corpus Christi College, to speak with Diet and Udal, my faithful brethren
and fellows in the Lord. By chance I met by the way a brother of ours, one
Master Eden, fellow of Magdalen, who, as soon as he saw me, said, we were
all undone, for Master Garret was returned, and was in prison. I said it
was not so; he said it was. I heard, quoth he, our Proctor, Master Cole,
say and declare the same this day. Then I told him what was done; and so
made haste to Frideswide, to find Master Clark, for I thought that he and
others would be in great sorrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vespers at the cathedral.</div>

<p>"Evensong was begun; the dean and the canons were there in their grey
amices; they were almost at Magnificat before I came thither. I stood in
the choir door and heard Master Taverner play, and others of the chapel
there sing, with and among whom I myself was wont to sing also; but now my
singing and music were turned into sighing and musing. As I there stood, in
cometh Dr. Cottisford,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the commissary, as fast as ever he could go,
bareheaded, as pale as ashes (I knew his grief well enough); and to the
dean he goeth into the choir, where he was sitting in his stall, and talked
with him, very sorrowfully: what, I know not; but whereof I might and did
truly guess. I went aside from the choir door to see and hear more. The
commissary and dean came out of the choir, wonderfully troubled as it
seemed. About the middle of the church, met them Dr. London,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> puffing,
blustering, and blowing like a hungry and greedy lion seeking his prey.
They talked together awhile, but the commissary was much blamed by them,
insomuch that he wept for sorrow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
"The doctors departed, and sent abroad their servants and spies everywhere.
Master Clark, about the middle of the
compline,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
came forth of the
choir. I followed him to his chamber, and declared what had happened that
afternoon of Master Garret's escape. Then he sent for one Master Sumner and
<span class="sidenote">The brothers meet.</span>
Master Bets, fellows and canons there. In the meantime he gave me a very
godly exhortation, praying God to give us all the wisdom of the serpent and
the harmlessness of doves, for we should shortly have much need thereof.
When Master Sumner and Master Bets came, he caused me to declare again the
whole matter to them two. Then desiring them to tell our other brethren in
that college, I went to Corpus Christi College, to comfort our brethren
there, where I found in Diet's chamber, looking for me, Fitzjames, Diet,
and Udal. They all knew the matter before by Master Eden, whom I had sent
unto Fitzjames. So I tarried there and supped with them, where they had
provided meat and drink for us before my coming; and when we had ended,
Fitzjames would needs have me to lie that night with him in my old lodging
at Alban's Hall. But small rest and little sleep took we both there that
night."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sunday, Feb. 22.</div>

<p>The next day, which was Sunday, Dalaber rose at five o'clock, and as soon
as he could leave the Hall, hastened off to his rooms at Gloucester. The
night had been wet and stormy, and his shoes and stockings were covered
with mud. The college gates, when he reached them, were still closed, an
unusual thing at that hour; and he walked up and down under the walls in
the bleak grey morning, till the clock struck seven, "much disquieted, his
head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> full of forecasting cares," but resolved, like a brave man, that come
what would, he would accuse no one, and declare nothing but what he saw was
already known. The gates were at last opened; he went to his rooms, and for
some time his key would not turn in the door, the lock having been meddled
<span class="sidenote">Dalaber's rooms searched by the commissary and the police.</span>
with. At length he succeeded in entering, and found everything in
confusion, his bed tossed and tumbled, his study-door open, and his clothes
strewed about the floor. A monk who occupied the opposite rooms, hearing
him return, came to him and said that the commissary and the two proctors
had been there looking for Garret. Bills and swords had been thrust through
the bed-straw, and every corner of the room searched for him. Finding
nothing, they had left orders that Dalaber, as soon as he returned, should
appear before the prior of the students.</p>

<p>"This so troubled me," Dalaber says, "that I forgot to make clean my hose
and shoes, and to shift me into another gown; and all bedirted as I was, I
went to the said prior's chamber." The prior asked him where he had slept
that night. At Alban's Hall, he answered, with his old bedfellow,
Fitzjames. The prior said he did not believe him, and asked if Garret had
been at his rooms the day before. He replied that he had. Whither had he
<span class="sidenote">Dalaber is arrested. He is examined about his friend's escape,
and tells a lie.</span>
gone, then? the prior inquired; and where was he at that time? "I
answered," says Dalaber, "that I knew not, unless he was gone to Woodstock;
he told me that he would go there, because one of the keepers had promised
him a piece or venison to make merry with at Shrovetide. This tale I
thought meetest, though it were nothing so."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">He is taken to Lincoln College, and re&euml;xamined by the commissary
and two other heads of houses.</div>

<p>At this moment the university beadle entered with two of the commissary's
servants, bringing a message to the prior that he should repair at once to
Lincoln, taking Dalaber with him. "I was brought into the chapel," the
latter continues, "and there I found Dr. Cottisford, commissary; Dr.
Higdon, Dean of Cardinal's College; and Dr. London, Warden of New College;
standing together at the altar. They called for chairs and sate down, and
then [ordered] me to come to them; they asked me what my name was, how long
I had been at the university, what I studied," with various other
inquiries: the clerk of the university, meanwhile, bringing pens, ink, and
paper, and arranging a table with a few loose boards upon tressels. A mass
book, he says, was then placed before him, and he was commanded to lay his
hand upon it, and swear that he would answer truly such questions as should
be asked him. At first he refused; but afterwards, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> persuaded,
"partly by fair words, and partly by great threats," he promised to do as
they would have him; but in his heart he "meant nothing so to do." "So I
laid my hand on the book," he goes on, "and one of them gave me my oath,
and commanded me to kiss the book. They made great courtesy between them
who should examine me; at last, the rankest Pharisee of them all took upon
him to do it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He again tells a lie.</div>

<p>"Then he asked me again, by my oath, where Master Garret was, and whither I
had conveyed him. I said I had not conveyed him, nor yet wist where he was,
nor whither he was gone, except he were gone to Woodstock, as I had before
said. Surely, they said, I brought him some whither this morning, for they
might well perceive by my foul shoes and dirty hosen that I had travelled
with him the most part of the night. I answered plainly, that I lay at
Alban's Hall with Sir Fitzjames, and that I had good witness thereof. They
asked me where I was at evensong. I told them at Frideswide, and that I
saw, first, Master Commissary, and then Master Doctor London, come thither
<span class="sidenote">He is threatened with the rack,</span>
to Master Dean. Doctor London and the Dean threatened me that if I would
not tell the truth I should surely be sent to the Tower of London, and
there be racked, and put into Little-ease.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>"At last when they could get nothing out of me whereby to hurt or accuse
any man, or to know anything of that which they sought, they all three
together brought me up a long stairs, into a great chamber, over Master
Commissary's chamber, wherein stood a great pair of very high stocks. Then
Master Commissary asked me for my purse and girdle, and took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">And is put in the stocks.</span>
away my money and my knives; and then they put my legs into the stocks, and so locked me
fast in them, in which I sate, my feet being almost as high as my head; and
so they departed, locking fast the door, and leaving me alone.</p>

<p>"When they were all gone, then came into my remembrance the worthy
forewarning and godly declaration of that most constant martyr of God,
Master John Clark, who, well nigh two years before that, when I did
earnestly desire him to grant me to be his scholar, said unto me after this
sort: 'Dalaber, you desire you wot not what, and that which you are, I
fear, unable to take upon you; for though now my preaching be sweet and
pleasant to you, because there is no persecution laid on you for it, yet
the time will come, and that, peradventure, shortly, if ye continue to live
godly therein, that God will lay on you the cross of persecution, to try
you whether you can as pure gold abide the fire. You shall be called and
judged a heretic; you shall be abhorred of the world; your own friends and
kinsfolk will forsake you, and also hate you; you shall be cast into
prison, and none shall dare to help you; you shall be accused before
bishops, to your reproach and shame, to the great sorrow of all your
friends and kinsfolk. Then will ye wish ye had never known this doctrine;
then will ye curse Clark, and wish that ye had never known him because he
hath brought you to all these troubles.'</p>

<p>"At which words I was so grieved that I fell down on my knees at his feet,
and with tears and sighs besought him that, for the tender mercy of God, he
would not refuse me; saying that I trusted, verily, that he which had begun
this in me would not forsake me, but would give me grace to continue
therein to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> end. When he heard me say so, he came to me, took me in his
arms and kissed me, the tears trickling from his eyes; and said unto me:
'The Lord God Almighty grant you so to do; and from henceforth for ever,
take me for your father, and I will take you for my son in Christ.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">He still refuses to confess where Garret is gone.</div>

<p>In these meditations the long Sunday morning wore away. A little before
noon the commissary came again to see if his prisoner was more amenable;
finding him, however, still obstinate, he offered him some dinner&mdash;a
promise which we will hope he fulfilled, for here Dalaber's own narrative
abruptly forsakes us,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> leaving uncompleted, at this point, the most
vivid picture which remains to us of a fraction of English life in the
reign of Henry VIII. If the curtain fell finally on the little group of
students, this narrative alone would furnish us with rare insight into the
circumstances under which the Protestants fought their way. The story,
however, can be carried something further, and the strangest incident
connected with it remains to be told.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monday, Feb. 23.</div>

<p>Dalaber breaks off on Sunday at noon. The same day, or early the following
morning, he was submitted once more to examination: this time, for the
discovery of his own offences, and to induce him to give up his
confederates. With respect to the latter he proved "marvellous obstinate."
"All that was gotten of him was with much difficulty;" nor would he confess
to any names as connected with heresy or heretics except that of Clark,
<span class="sidenote">But acknowledges his own heresies.</span>
which was already known. About himself he was more open. He wrote his "book
of heresy," that is, his confession Of faith, "with his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hand,"&mdash;his
evening's occupation, perhaps, in the stocks in the rector of Lincoln's
house; and the next day he was transferred to prison.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Search for books.</div>

<p>This offender being thus disposed of, and strict secresy being observed to
prevent the spread of alarm, a rapid search was set on foot for books in
all suspected quarters. The fear of the authorities was that "the infect
persons would flee," and "convey" their poison "away with
them."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The officials, once on the scent of heresy, were skilful in running down the
game. No time was lost, and by Monday evening many of "the brethren" had
been arrested, their rooms examined, and their forbidden treasures
discovered and rifled. Dalaber's store was found "hid with marvellous
secresy;" and in one student's desk a duplicate of Garret's list&mdash;the
titles of the volumes with which the first "Religious Tract Society" set
themselves to convert England.</p>

<p>Information of all this was conveyed in haste by Dr. London to the Bishop
of Lincoln, as the ordinary of the university; and the warden told his
story with much self-congratulation. On one point, however, the news which
he had to communicate was less satisfactory. Garret himself was
gone&mdash;utterly gone. Dalaber was obstinate, and no clue to the track of the
<span class="sidenote">The heads of houses consult one expert in astronomy to discover
the track of Garret.</span>
fugitive could be discovered. The police were at fault; neither bribes nor
threats could elicit anything; and in these desperate circumstances, as he
told the bishop, the three heads of houses conceived that they might strain
a point of propriety for so good a purpose as to prevent the escape of a
heretic. Accordingly, after a full report
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the points of their success,
Doctor London went on to relate the following remarkable proceeding:</p>

<p>"After Master Garret escaped, <i>the commissary being in extreme pensiveness,
knew no other remedy but this extraordinary, and caused a figure to be made
by one expert in astronomy&mdash;and his judgment doth continually persist upon
this, that he fled in a tawny coat south-eastward, and is in the middle of
London, and will shortly to the sea side</i>. He was curate unto the parson of
Honey Lane.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> It is likely he is privily cloaked there. Wherefore, as
soon as I knew the judgment of this astronomer, I thought it expedient and
my duty with all speed to ascertain your good lordship of all the premises;
that in time your lordship may advertise my lord his Grace, and my lord of
London. It will be a gracious deed that he and all his pestiferous works,
which he carrieth about, might be taken, to the salvation of his soul,
opening of many privy heresies, and extinction of the same."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuesday, Feb. 24.</div>

<p>We might much desire to know what the bishop's sensations were in reading
this letter&mdash;to know whether it occurred to him that in this na&iuml;ve
acknowledgment, the Oxford heresy hunters were themselves confessing to an
act of heresy; and that by the law of the church, which they were so eager
to administer, they were liable to the same death which they were so
zealous to secure for the poor vendors of Testaments. So indeed they really
were. Consulting the stars had been ruled from immemorial time to be
dealing with the devil; the penalty of it was the same as for witchcraft;
yet here was a reverend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> warden of a college considering it his duty to
write eagerly of a discovery obtained by these forbidden means, to his own
diocesan, begging him to communicate with the Cardinal of York and the
Bishop of London, that three of the highest church authorities in England
might become <i>participes criminis</i>, by acting on this diabolical
information.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principal ports set for Garret's capture.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the commissary, not wholly relying on the astrologer, but
resolving prudently to make use of the more earthly resources which were at
his disposal, had sent information of Garret's escape to the corporations
of Dover, Rye, Winchester, Southampton, and Bristol, with descriptions of
the person of the fugitive; and this step was taken with so much
expedition, that before the end of the week no vessel was allowed to leave
either of those harbours without being strictly searched.</p>

<p>The natural method proved more effectual than the supernatural, though
again with the assistance of a singular accident. Garret had not gone to
London; unfortunately for himself, he had not gone to Wales as he had
intended. He left Oxford, as we saw, the evening of Saturday, February
21st. That night he reached a village called
Corkthrop,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> where he lay
concealed till Wednesday; and then, not in the astrologer's orange-tawny
<span class="sidenote">Garret goes to Bristol, and is taken by the father-in-law of the
Oxford proctor.</span>
dress, but in "a courtier's coat and buttoned cap," which he had by some
means contrived to procure, he set out again on his forlorn journey, making
for the nearest sea-port, Bristol, where the police were looking out to
receive him. His choice of Bristol was peculiarly unlucky. The "chapman" of
the town was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the step-father of Cole, the Oxford proctor: to this person,
whose name was Master Wilkyns, the proctor had written a special letter, in
addition to the commissary's circular; and the family connexion acting as a
spur to his natural activity, a coast-guard had been set before Garret's
arrival, to watch for him down the Avon banks, and along the Channel shore
for fifteen miles. All the Friday night "the mayor, with the aldermen, and
twenty of the council, had kept privy watch," and searched suspicious
houses at Master Wilkyns's instance; the whole population were on the
alert, and when the next afternoon, a week after his escape, the poor
heretic, footsore and weary, dragged himself into the town, he found that
he had walked into the lion's mouth.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He quickly learnt the danger to
which he was exposed, and hurried off again with the best speed which he
could command; but it was too late. The chapman, alert and indefatigable,
had heard that a stranger had been seen in the street; the police were set
upon his track, and he was taken at Bedminster, a suburb on the opposite
bank of the Avon, and hurried before a magistrate, where he at once
acknowledged his identity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saturday, Feb. 28.</div>

<p>With such happy success were the good chapman's efforts rewarded. Yet in
this world there is no light without shadow; no pleasure without its alloy.
In imagination, Master Wilkyns had thought of himself conducting the
<span class="sidenote">Master Wilkyns's triumph, hopes, and disappointment.</span>
prisoner in triumph into the streets of Oxford, the hero of the hour. The
sour formality of the law condemned him to ill-merited disappointment.
Garret had been taken beyond the liberties of the city; it was necessary,
therefore, to commit him to the county
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
gaol, and he was sent to Ilchester.
"Master Wilkyns offered himself to be bound to the said justice in three
<span class="sidenote">Garret is sent to Ilchester, and thence to London,</span>
hundred pounds to discharge him of the said Garret, and to see him surely
to Master Proctor's of Oxford; yet could he not have him, for the justice
said that the order of the law would not so serve."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The fortunate
captor had therefore to content himself with the consciousness of his
exploit, and the favourable report of his conduct which was sent to the
bishops; and Garret went first to Ilchester, and thence was taken by
special writ, and surrendered to Wolsey.</p>

<p>Thus unkind had fortune shown herself to the chief criminal, guilty of the
unpardonable offence of selling Testaments at Oxford, and therefore hunted
down as a mad dog, and a common enemy of mankind. He escaped for the
<span class="sidenote">Where he abjures.</span>
present the heaviest consequences, for Wolsey persuaded him to abjure. A
few years later we shall again meet him, when he had recovered his better
nature, and would not abjure, and died as a brave man should die. In the
mean time we return to the university, where the authorities were busy
trampling out the remains of the conflagration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The investigation at Oxford continues.</div>

<p>Two days after his letter respecting the astrologer, the Warden of New
College wrote again to the Diocesan, with an account of his further
proceedings. He was an efficient inquisitor, and the secrets of the poor
undergraduates had been unravelled to the last thread. Some of "the
brethren" had confessed; all were in prison; and the doctor desired
instructions as to what should be done with them. It must be said for Dr.
London, that he was anxious that they should be treated leniently. Dalaber
de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>scribed him as a roaring lion, and he was a bad man, and came at last to
a bad end. But it is pleasant to find that even he, a mere blustering
arrogant official, was not wholly without redeeming points of character;
and as little good will be said for him hereafter, the following passage in
his second letter may be placed to the credit side of his account. The tone
in which he wrote was at least humane, and must pass for more than an
expression of natural kindness, when it is remembered that he was
addressing a person with whom tenderness for heresy was a crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctor London writes to the Bishop of Lincoln, advising a
general pardon.</div>

<p>"These youths," he said, "have not been long conversant with Master Garret,
nor have greatly perused his mischievous books; and long before Master
Garret was taken, divers of them were weary of these works, and delivered
them to Dalaber. I am marvellous sorry for the young men. If they be openly
called upon, although they appear not greatly infect, yet they shall never
avoid slander, because my Lord's Grace did send for Master Garret to be
taken. I suppose his Grace will know of your good lordship everything.
Nothing shall be hid, I assure your good lordship, an every one of them
were my brother; and I do only make this moan for these youths, for surely
they be of the most towardly young men in Oxford; and as far as I do yet
perceive, not greatly infect, but much to blame for reading any part of
these works."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Doctor London's intercession, if timid, was generous; he obviously wished
to suggest that the matter should be hushed up, and that the offending
parties should be dismissed with a reprimand. If the decision had rested
with Wolsey, it is likely that this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
view would have been readily acted
upon. But the Bishop of Lincoln was a person in whom the spirit of humanity
had been long exorcised by the spirit of an ecclesiastic. He was staggering
along the last years of a life against which his own
register<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> bears
dreadful witness, and he would not burden his conscience with mercy to
<span class="sidenote">The bishop insists on punishment.</span>
heretics. He would not mar the completeness of his barbarous career. He
singled out three of the prisoners&mdash;Garret, Clark, and
Ferrars<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;and
especially entreated that they should be punished. "They be three perilous
men," he wrote to Wolsey, "and have been the occasion of the corruption of
youth. They have done much mischief, and for the love of God let them be
handled thereafter."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Wolsey had Garret in his own keeping, and declined to surrender him.
Ferrars had been taken at the Black Friars, in London,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and making his
submission, was respited, and escaped with abjuration. But Clark was at
Oxford, in the bishop's power, and the wicked old man was allowed to work
his will upon him. A bill of heresy was drawn, which the prisoner was
<span class="sidenote">Clark dies in prison.</span>
required to sign. He refused, and must have been sent to the stake, had he
not escaped by dying prematurely of the treatment which he had received in
prison.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> His last words only are recorded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> He was refused the
communion, not perhaps as a special act of cruelty, but because the laws of
the church would not allow the holy thing to be profaned by the touch of a
heretic. When he was told that it would not be suffered, he said "<i>crede et
manduc&acirc;sti</i>"&mdash;"faith<span class="sidenote">His last words.</span>
is the communion;" and so passed away; a very noble
person, so far as the surviving features of his character will let us
judge; one who, if his manhood had fulfilled the promise of his youth,
would have taken no common part in the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dalaber and his friends carry fagots in High-street.</div>

<p>The remaining brethren were then dispersed. Some were sent home to their
friends,&mdash;others, Anthony Dalaber among them, were placed on their trial,
and being terrified at their position, recanted, and were sentenced to do
penance. Ferrars was brought to Oxford for the occasion, and we discern
indistinctly (for the mere fact is all which survives) a great fire at
Carfax; a crowd of spectators, and a procession of students marching up
High-street with fagots on their shoulders, the solemn beadles leading them
with gowns and maces. The ceremony was repeated to which Dr. Barnes had
been submitted at St. Paul's. They were taken three times round the fire,
throwing in each first their fagot, and then some one of the offending
books, in token that they repented and renounced their errors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxford is purged.</div>

<p>Thus was Oxford purged of heresy. The state of innocence which Dr. London
pathetically lamented<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> was restored, and the heads of houses had peace
till their rest was broken by a ruder storm.</p>

<p>In this single specimen we may see a complete image of Wolsey's
persecution, as with varying details it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> was carried out in every town and
village from the Tweed to the Land's End. I dwell on the stories of
individual suffering, not to colour the narrative, or to reawaken feelings
of bitterness which may well rest now and sleep for ever, but because,
through the years in which it was struggling for recognition, the history
<span class="sidenote">The early history of Protestantism is the history of its martyrs
and confessors,</span>
of Protestantism is the history of its martyrs. No rival theology, as I
have said, had as yet shaped itself into formulas. We have not to trace any
slow growing elaboration of opinion. Protestantism, before it became an
establishment, was a refusal to live any longer in a lie. It was a falling
back upon the undefined untheoretic rules of truth and piety which lay upon
the surface of the Bible, and a determination rather to die than to mock
with unreality any longer the Almighty Maker of the world. We do not look
in the dawning manifestations of such a spirit for subtleties of intellect.
Intellect, as it ever does, followed in the wake of the higher virtues of
<span class="sidenote">And its evidences, their endurance and suffering.</span>
manly honesty and truthfulness. And the evidences which were to effect the
world's conversion were no cunningly arranged syllogistic demonstrations,
but once more those loftier evidences which lay in the calm endurance by
heroic men of the extremities of suffering, and which touched, not the mind
with conviction, but the heart with admiring reverence.</p>

<p>In the concluding years of his administration, Wolsey was embarrassed with
the divorce. Difficulties were gathering round him, from the failure of his
hopes abroad and the wreck of his popularity at home; and the activity of
the persecution was something relaxed, as the guiding mind of the great
minister ceased to have leisure to attend to it. The bishops, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
continued, each in his own diocese, to act with such vigour as they
<span class="sidenote">Wolsey falls, but the persecution is continued by the bishops.</span>
possessed. Their courts were unceasingly occupied with vexatious suits,
commenced without reason, and conducted without justice. They summoned
arbitrarily as suspected offenders whoever had the misfortune to have
provoked their dislike; either compelling them to criminate themselves by
questions on the intricacies of theology,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> or allowing sentence to be
passed against them on the evidence of abandoned persons, who would not
have been admissible as witnesses before the secular tribunals.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The House of Commons, in checking causeless prosecutions, has no
wish to protect those who are really heretical.</div>

<p>It might have been thought that the clear perception which was shown by the
House of Commons of the injustice with which the trials for heresy were
conducted, the disregard, shameless and flagrant, of the provisions of the
statutes under which the bishops were enabled to proceed, might have led
them to reconsider the equity of persecution in itself; or, at least, to
remove from the office of judges persons who had shown themselves so
signally unfit to exercise that office. It would have been indecent,
however, if not impossible, to transfer to a civil tribunal the cognizance
of opinion; and, on the other hand, there was as yet among the upper
classes of the laity no kind of disposition to be lenient towards those who
were really unorthodox. The desire so far was only to check the reckless
and random accusations of persons whose offence was to have criticised, not
the doctrine, but the moral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
conduct of the church authorities. The
<span class="sidenote">The Protestants rather lose than gain in the revolution which
followed on the fall of Wolsey.</span>
Protestants, although from the date of the meeting of the parliament and
Wolsey's fall their ultimate triumph was certain, gained nothing in its
immediate consequences. They suffered rather from the eagerness of the
political reformers to clear themselves from complicity with heterodoxy;
and the bishops were even taunted with the spiritual dissensions of the
realm as an evidence of their indolence and misconduct.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Language of
this kind boded ill for the "Christian Brethren"; and the choice of
Wolsey's successor for the office of chancellor soon confirmed their
apprehensions: Wolsey had chastised them with whips; Sir Thomas More would
<span class="sidenote">Sir Thomas More's chancellorship.</span>
chastise them with scorpions; and the philosopher of the <i>Utopia</i>, the
friend of Erasmus, whose life was of blameless beauty, whose genius was
cultivated to the highest attainable perfection, was to prove to the world
that the spirit of persecution is no peculiar attribute of the pedant, the
bigot, or the fanatic, but may coexist with the fairest graces of the human
character. The lives of remarkable men usually illustrate some emphatic
truth. Sir Thomas More may be said to have lived to illustrate the
necessary tendencies of Romanism in an honest mind convinced of its truth;
to show that the test of sincerity in a man who professes to regard
<span class="sidenote">The true test of sincerity in a Catholic.</span>
orthodoxy as an essential of salvation, is not the readiness to endure
persecution, but the courage which will venture to inflict it.</p>

<p>The seals were delivered to the new chancellor in November, 1529. By his
oath on entering office he was bound to exert himself to the utmost for the
sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>pression of heretics:<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> he was bound, however, equally to obey the
conditions under which the law allowed them to be suppressed. Unfortunately
for his reputation as a judge, he permitted the hatred of "that kind of
men," which he did not conceal that he felt,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> to obscure his conscience
on this important feature of his duty, and tempt him to imitate the worst
iniquities of the bishops. I do not intend in this place to relate the
stories of his cruelties in his house at Chelsea,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which he himself
partially denied, and which at least we may hope were exaggerated. Being
obliged to confine myself to specific instances, I choose rather those on
which the evidence is not open to question; and which prove against More,
not the zealous execution of a cruel law, for which we may not fairly hold
him responsible, but a disregard, in the highest degree censurable, of his
obligations as a judge.</p>

<p>The acts under which heretics were liable to punishment, were the 15th of
the 2d of Henry IV., and the 1st of the 2d of Henry V.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In cases of heresy, the legal period of imprisonment previous to
trial was three months.</div>

<p>By the act of Henry IV., the bishops were bound to bring offenders to trial
in open court, within three months of their arrest, if there were no lawful
impediment. If conviction followed, they might imprison at their
discretion. Except under these conditions, they were not at liberty to
imprison.</p>

<p>By the act of Henry V., a heretic, if he was first indicted before a
secular judge, was to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
delivered within ten days (or, if possible, a<span class="sidenote">In cases of indictments before the chancellor, the accused
person was to be delivered to the bishops within ten days.</span>
shorter period) to the bishop, "to be acquit or convict" by a jury in the
spiritual court, and to be dealt with accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The secular judge might detain a heretic for ten days before delivering him
to the bishop. The bishop might detain him for three months before his
trial. Neither the secular judge nor the bishop had power to inflict
indefinite imprisonment at will while the trial was delayed; nor, if on the
trial the bishop failed in securing a conviction, was he at liberty to
detain the accused person any longer on the same charge, because the result
was not satisfactory to himself. These provisions were not preposterously
<span class="sidenote">More's carelessness in observing these provisions.</span>
lenient. Sir Thomas More should have found no difficulty in observing them
himself, and in securing the observance of them by the bishops, at least in
cases where he was himself responsible for the first committal. It is to be
feared that he forgot that he was a judge in his eagerness to be a
partisan, and permitted no punctilious legal scruples to interfere with the
more important object of ensuring punishment to heretics.</p>

<p>The first case which I shall mention is one in which the Bishop of London
was principally guilty; not, however, without More's countenance, and, if
Foxe is to be believed, his efficient support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Case of Thomas Philips.</div>

<p>In December, 1529, the month succeeding his appointment as chancellor,
More, at the instance of the Bishop of London,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> arrested a citizen of
London, Thomas Philips by name, on a charge of heresy.</p>

<p>The prisoner was surrendered in due form to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> diocesan, and was brought
to trial on the 4th of February; a series of articles being alleged against
him by Foxford, the bishop's vicar-general. The articles were of the usual
kind. The prisoner was accused of having used unorthodox expressions on
transubstantiation, on purgatory, pilgrimages, and confession. It does not
appear whether any witnesses were produced. The vicar-general brought his
accusations on the ground of general rumour, and failed to maintain them.
Whether there were witnesses or not, neither the particular offences, nor
even the fact of the general rumour, could be proved to the satisfaction of
the jury. Philips himself encountered each separate charge with a specific
denial, declaring that he neither was, nor ever had been, other than
orthodox; and the result of the trial was, that no conviction could be
obtained. The prisoner "was found so clear from all manner of infamous
slanders and suspicions, that all the people before the said bishop,
shouting in judgment as with one voice, openly witnessed his good name and
fame, to the great reproof and shame of the said bishop, if he had not been
ashamed to be ashamed."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The case had broken down; the proceedings were
over, and by law the accused person was free. But the law, except when it
was on their own side, was of little importance to the church authorities.
As they had failed to prove Philips guilty of heresy, they called upon him
to confess his guilt by abjuring it; "as if," he says, "there were no
difference between a nocent and an innocent, between a guilty and a not
guilty."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>He refused resolutely, and was remanded to prison,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> in open violation of
the law. The bishop, in conjunction with Sir Thomas More,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> sent for him
from time to time, submitting him to private examinations, which again were
illegal; and urged the required confession, in order, as Philips says, "to
save the bishop's credit."</p>

<p>The further they advanced, the more difficult it was to recede; and the
bishop at length, irritated at his failure, concluded the process with an
arbitrary sentence of excommunication. From this sentence, whether just or
unjust, there was then no appeal, except to the pope. The wretched man, in
virtue of it, was no longer under the protection of the law, and was
<span class="sidenote">He is imprisoned unconvicted for three years.</span>
committed to the Tower, where he languished for three years, protesting,
but protesting fruitlessly, against the tyranny which had crushed him, and
clamouring for justice in the deaf ears of pedants who knew not what
justice meant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He appeals at length to the House of Commons, and recovers his
liberty.</div>

<p>If this had occurred at the beginning of the century, the prisoner would
have been left to die, as countless multitudes had already died, unheard,
uncared for, unthought of; the victim not of deliberate cruelty, but of
that frightfullest portent, folly armed with power. Happily the years of
his imprisonment had been years of swift revolution. The House of Commons
had become a tribunal where oppression would not any longer cry wholly
unheard; Philips appealed to it for protection, and recovered his
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bishop of London responsible in the first degree; but More
was severely censurable.</div>

<p>The weight of guilt in this instance presses essentially on Stokesley; yet
a portion of the blame must be borne also by the chancellor, who first
placed Philips in Stokesley's hands; who took part in the illegal private
examinations, and who could not have been ignorant of the prisoner's
ultimate fate. If, however, it be thought unjust to charge a good man's
memory with an offence in which his part was only secondary, the following
iniquity was wholly and exclusively his own. I relate the story without
comment in the address of the injured person to More's
successor.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

your poor bedeman John
Field, how that the next morrow upon twelfth
day,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
in the twenty-first
year of our sovereign lord the King's Highness, Sir Thomas More, Knight,
then being Lord Chancellor of England, did send certain of his servants,
and caused your said bedeman, with certain others, to be brought to his
place at Chelsea, and there kept him (after what manner and fashion it were
now long to tell), by the space of eighteen
days;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
and then set him at
liberty, binding him to appear before him again the eighth day following in
the Star Chamber, which was Candlemas eve; at which day your said bedeman
appeared, and was then sent to the Fleet, where he continued until Palm
<span class="sidenote">Illegally imprisoned by More.</span>
Sunday two years after, [in violation of both the statutes,] kept so close
the first quarter that his keeper only might visit him; and always after
closed up with those that were handled most straitly; often searched,
sometimes even at midnight; besides snares and traps laid to take him in.
Betwixt Michaelmas and Allhalloween tide next after his coming to prison
there was taken from your bedeman a Greek vocabulary, price five shillings;
Saint Cyprian's works, with a book of the same Sir Thomas More's making,
named the <i>Supplication of Souls</i>. For what cause it was done he committeth
to the judgment of God, that seeth the souls of all persons. The said Palm
Sunday, which was also our Lady's day, towards night there came two
officers of the Fleet, named George Porter and John Butler, and took your
bedeman into a ward alone, and there, after long searching, found his purse
hanging at his girdle; which they took, and shook out the money to the sum
of ten shillings, which was sent him to buy such necessaries as he lacked,
and delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
him again his purse, well and truly keeping the money to
themselves, as they said for their fees; and forthwith carried him from the
Fleet (where he lost such poor bedding as he then had, and could never
since get it), and delivered him to the Marshalsea, under our gracious
sovereign's commandment and Sir Thomas More's. When the Sunday before the
Rogation week following, your bedeman fell sick; and the Whitsun Monday was
carried out on four men's backs, and delivered to his friends to be
recovered if it so pleased God. At which time the keeper took for your
bedeman's fees other ten shillings, when four shillings should have
sufficed if he had been delivered in good health.</p>

<p>"Within three weeks it pleased God to set your bedeman on his feet, so that
he might walk abroad. Whereof when Sir Thomas More heard (who went out of
his chancellorship about the time your bedeman was carried out of prison),
although he had neither word nor deed which he could ever truly lay to your
bedeman's charge, yet made he such means by the Bishops of Winchester and
London, as your bedeman heard say, to the Hon. Lord Thomas Duke of Norfolk,
that he gave new commandment to the keeper of the Marshalsea to attach
again your said bedeman; which thing was speedily done the Sunday three
weeks after his deliverance. And so he continued in prison again until
Saint Lawrence tide following; at which time money was given to the keeper,
and some things he took which were not given, and then was your bedeman
re-delivered through the king's goodness, under sureties bound in a certain
sum, that he should appear the first day of the next term following, and
then day by day until his dismission. And so hath your bede<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>man been at
liberty now twelve months waiting daily from term to term, and nothing laid
to his charge as before.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, the premises tenderly considered, and also your said bedeman's
great poverty, he most humbly beseecheth your goodness that he may now be
clearly discharged; and if books, money, or other things seem to be taken
or kept from him otherwise than justice would, eftsoons he beseecheth you
that ye will command it to be restored.</p>

<p>"As for his long imprisonment, with other griefs thereto appertaining, he
looketh not to have recompense of man; but committeth his whole cause to
God, to whom your bedeman shall daily pray, according as he is bound, that
ye may so order and govern the realm that it may be to the honour of God
and your heavenly and everlasting reward."</p>

<p>I do not find the result of this petition, but as it appeared that Henry
had interested himself in the story, it is likely to have been successful.
We can form but an imperfect judgment on the merits of the case, for we
have only the sufferer's <i>ex parte</i> complaint, and More might probably have
been able to make some counter-statement. But the illegal imprisonment
cannot be explained away, and cannot be palliated; and when a judge permits
himself to commit an act of arbitrary tyranny, we argue from the known to
the unknown, and refuse reasonably to give him credit for equity where he
was so little careful of law.</p>

<p>Yet a few years of misery in a prison was but an insignificant misfortune
when compared with the fate under which so many other poor men were at this
time overwhelmed. Under Wolsey's chancellorship the stake had been
comparatively idle; he possessed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a remarkable power of making recantation
<span class="sidenote">Contrast between Wolsey and More in the treatment
of heretics.</span>
easy; and there is, I believe, no instance in which an accused heretic was
brought under his immediate cognizance, where he failed to arrange some
terms by which submission was made possible. With Wolsey heresy was an
error&mdash;with More it was a crime. Soon after the seals changed hands the
Smithfield fires recommenced; and, the chancellor acting in concert with
<span class="sidenote">The Smithfield fires recommence.</span>
them, the bishops resolved to obliterate, in these edifying spectacles, the
recollection of their general infirmities. The crime of the offenders
varied,&mdash;sometimes it was a denial of the corporal presence, more often it
was a reflection too loud to be endured on the character and habits of the
clergy; but whatever it was, the alternative lay only between abjuration
humiliating as ingenuity could make it, or a dreadful death. The hearts of
many failed them in the trial, and of all the confessors those perhaps do
not deserve the least compassion whose weakness betrayed them, who sank and
died broken-hearted. Of these silent sufferers history knows nothing. A
few, unable to endure the misery of having, as they supposed, denied their
Saviour, returned to the danger from which they had fled, and washed out
their fall in martyrdom. Latimer has told us the story of his friend
<span class="sidenote">Troubles of Bilney.</span>
Bilney&mdash;little Bilney, or Saint Bilney,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as he calls him, his companion
at Cambridge, to whom he owed his own conversion. Bilney, after escaping
through Wolsey's hands in 1527, was again cited in 1529 before the Bishop
of London. Three times he refused to recant. He was offered a fourth and
last chance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
The temptation was too strong, and he fell. For two years he
was hopelessly miserable; at length his braver nature prevailed. There was
no pardon for a relapsed heretic, and if he was again in the bishop's hands
he knew well the fate which awaited him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He "goes up to Jerusalem."</div>

<p>He told his friends, in language touchingly significant, that "he would go
up to Jerusalem"; and began to preach in the fields. The journey which he
had undertaken was not to be a long one. He was heard to say in a sermon,
that of his personal knowledge certain things which had been offered in
pilgrimage had been given to abandoned women. The priests, he affirmed,
"take away the offerings, and hang them about their women's necks; and
after that they take them off the women, if they please them not, and hang
them again upon the images."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This was Bilney's heresy, or formed the
ground of his arrest; he was orthodox on the mass, and also on the power of
the keys; but the secrets of the sacred order were not to be betrayed with
impunity. He was seized, and hurried before the Bishop of Norwich; and
being found heterodox on the papacy and the mediation of the saints, by the
Bishop of Norwich he was sent to the stake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James Bainham,</div>

<p>Another instance of recovered courage, and of martyrdom consequent upon it,
is that of James Bainham, a barrister of the Middle Temple. This story is
noticeable from a very curious circumstance connected with it.</p>

<p>Bainham had challenged suspicion by marrying the widow of Simon Fish, the
author of the famous <i>Beggars' Petition</i>, who had died in 1528; and, soon
after his marriage, was challenged to give an account of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> faith. He was
charged with denying transubstantiation, with questioning the value of the
confessional, and the power of the keys; and the absence of authoritative
<span class="sidenote">The latitudinarian martyr.</span>
Protestant dogma had left his mind free to expand to a yet larger belief.
He had ventured to assert, that "if a Turk, a Jew, or a Saracen do trust in
God and keep his law, he is a good Christian man,"<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>&mdash;a conception of
Christianity, a conception of Protestantism, which we but feebly dare to
whisper even at the present day. The proceedings against him commenced with
a demand that he should give up his books, and also the names of other
barristers with whom he was suspected to have held intercourse. He refused;
and in consequence his wife was imprisoned, and he himself was racked in
the Tower by order of Sir Thomas More. Enfeebled by suffering, he was then
brought before Stokesley, and terrified by the cold merciless eyes of his
<span class="sidenote">On his first trial he recants.</span>
judge, he gave way, not about his friends, but about himself: he abjured,
and was dismissed heartbroken. This was on the seventeenth of February. He
was only able to endure his wretchedness for a month. At the end of it, he
appeared at a secret meeting of the Christian Brothers, in "a warehouse in
Bow Lane," where he asked forgiveness of God and all the world for what he
had done; and then went out to take again upon his shoulders the heavy
burden of the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He recovers his courage,</div>

<p>The following Sunday, at the church of St. Augustine, he rose in his seat
with the fatal English Testament in his hand, and "declared openly, before
all the people, with weeping tears, that he had denied God," praying them
all to forgive him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> beware of his weakness; "for if I should not
return to the truth," he said, "this Word of God would damn me, body and
soul, at the day of judgment." And then he prayed "everybody rather to die
than to do as he did, for he would not feel such a hell again as he did
feel for all the world's good."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And is arrested again.</div>

<p>Of course but one event was to be looked for: he knew it, and himself wrote
to the bishop, telling him what he had done. No mercy was possible: he
looked for none, and he found none.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mercy of the church authorities.</div>

<p>Yet perhaps he found what the wise authorities thought to be some act of
mercy. They could not grant him pardon in this world upon any terms; but
they would not kill him till they had made an effort for his soul. He was
taken to the Bishop of London's coal-cellar at Fulham, the favourite
episcopal penance-chamber, where he was ironed and put in the stocks; and
there was left for many days, in the chill March weather, to bethink
himself. This failing to work conviction, he was carried to Sir Thomas
More's house at Chelsea, where for two nights he was chained to a post and
whipped; thence, again, he was taken back to Fulham for another week of
torture; and finally to the Tower, for a further fortnight, again with
ineffectual whippings.</p>

<p>The demands of charity were thus satisfied. The pious bishop and the
learned chancellor had exhausted their means of conversion; they had
discharged their consciences; and the law was allowed to take its course.
The prisoner was brought to trial on the 20th of April, as a relapsed
<span class="sidenote">He is burnt April 20, 1532.</span>
heretic. Sentence followed; and on the last of the month the drama
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> closed
in the usual manner at Smithfield. Before the fire was lighted Bainham made
a farewell address to the people, laying his death expressly to More, whom
he called his accuser and his judge.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The feelings with which these spectacles were witnessed by the
people.</div>

<p>It is unfortunately impossible to learn the feelings with which these
dreadful scenes were witnessed by the people. There are stories which show
that, in some instances, familiarity had produced the usual effect; that
the martyrdom of saints was at times of no more moment to an English crowd
than the execution of ordinary felons,&mdash;that it was a mere spectacle to the
idle, the hardened, and the curious. On the other hand, it is certain that
the behaviour of the sufferers was the argument which at last converted the
nation; and an effect which in the end was so powerful with the multitude
must have been visible long before in the braver and better natures. The
increasing number of prosecutions in London shows, also, that the leaven
was spreading. There were five executions in Smithfield between 1529 and
1533, besides those in the provinces. The prisons were crowded with
offenders who had abjured and were undergoing sentence; and the list of
those who were "troubled" in various ways is so extensive, as to leave no
doubt of the sympathy which, in London at least, must have been felt by
many, very many, of the spectators of the martyrs' deaths. We are left, in
this important point, mainly to conjecture; and if we were better furnished
with evidence, the language of ordinary narrative would fail to convey any
real notion of perplexed and various emotions. We have glimpses, however,
into the inner world of men, here and there of strange interest; and we
must regret that they are so few.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Suicide of a boy at Cambridge.</div>

<p>A poor boy at Cambridge, John Randall, of Christ's College, a relation of
Foxe the martyrologist, destroyed himself in these years in religious
desperation; he was found in his study hanging by his girdle, before an
open Bible, with his dead arm and finger stretched pitifully towards a
passage on predestination.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pavier, the town clerk of London, also destroys himself, under
strange circumstances.</div>

<p>A story even more remarkable is connected with Bainham's execution. Among
the lay officials present at the stake, was "one Pavier," town clerk of
London. This Pavier was a Catholic fanatic, and as the flames were about to
be kindled he burst out into violent and abusive language. The fire blazed
up, and the dying sufferer, as the red flickering tongues licked the flesh
from off his bones, turned to him and said, "May God forgive thee, and shew
more mercy than thou, angry reviler, shewest to me." The scene was soon
over; the town clerk went home. A week after, one morning when his wife had
gone to mass, he sent all his servants out of his house on one pretext or
another, a single girl only being left, and he withdrew to a garret at the
top of the house, which he used as an oratory. A large crucifix was on the
wall, and the girl having some question to ask, went to the room, and found
him standing before it "bitterly weeping." He told her to take his sword,
which was rusty, and clean it. She went away and left him; when she
returned, a little time after, he was hanging from a beam, dead. He was a
singular person. Edward Hall, the historian, knew him, and had heard him
say, that "if the king put forth the New Testament in English, he would not
live to bear it."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> And yet he could not bear to see a heretic die.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
What was it? Had the meaning of that awful figure hanging on the torturing
cross suddenly revealed itself? Had some inner voice asked him whether, in
the prayer for his persecutors with which Christ had parted out of life,
there might be some affinity with words which had lately sounded in his own
ears? God, into whose hands he threw himself, self-condemned in his
wretchedness, only knows the agony of that hour. Let the secret rest where
it lies, and let us be thankful for ourselves that we live in a changed
world.</p>

<p>Thus, however, the struggle went forward; a forlorn hope of saints led the
way up the breach, and paved with their bodies a broad road into the new
era; and the nation the meanwhile was unconsciously waiting till the works
of the enemy were won, and they could walk safely in and take possession.
<span class="sidenote">The two orders of martyrs.</span>
While men like Bilney and Bainham were teaching with words and writings,
there were stout English hearts labouring also on the practical side of the
same conflict, instilling the same lessons, and meeting for themselves the
same consequences. Speculative superstition was to be met with speculative
denial. Practical idolatry required a rougher method of disenchantment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The worship of relics, in its origin and in its abuse.</div>

<p>Every monastery, every parish church, had in those days its special relics,
its special images, its special something, to attract the interest of the
people. The reverence for the remains of noble and pious men, the dresses
which they had worn, or the bodies in which their spirits had lived, was in
itself a natural and pious emotion; but it had been petrified into a dogma;
and like every other imaginative feeling which is submitted to that bad
process, it had become a falsehood, a mere superstition, a substitute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> for
piety, not a stimulus to it, and a perpetual occasion of fraud. The people
brought offerings to the shrines where it was supposed that the relics were
of greatest potency. The clergy, to secure the offerings, invented the
relics, and invented the stories of the wonders which had been worked by
<span class="sidenote">Bishop Shaxton's inventory.</span>
them. The greatest exposure of these things took place at the visitation of
the religious houses. In the meantime, Bishop Shaxton's unsavoury inventory
of what passed under the name of relics in the diocese of Salisbury, will
furnish an adequate notion of these objects of popular veneration. There
"be set forth and commended unto the ignorant people," he said, "as I
myself of certain which be already come to my hands, have perfect
knowledge, stinking boots, mucky combes, ragged rochettes, rotten girdles,
pyl'd purses, great bullocks' horns, locks of hair, and filthy rags,
gobbetts of wood, under the name of parcels of the holy cross, and such
pelfry beyond estimation."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Besides matters of this kind, there were
<span class="sidenote">The wonder-working roods.</span>
images of the Virgin or of the Saints; above all, roods or crucifixes, of
especial potency, the virtues of which had begun to grow uncertain,
however, to sceptical Protestants; and from doubt to denial, and from
denial to passionate hatred, there were but a few brief steps. The most
<span class="sidenote">The rood of Boxley.</span>
famous of the roods was that of Boxley in Kent, which used to smile and
bow, or frown and shake its head, as its worshippers were generous or
closehanded. The fortunes and misfortunes of this image I shall by and bye
have to relate. There was another, however, at Dovercourt, in Suffolk, of
<span class="sidenote">The rood of Dovercourt.</span>
scarcely inferior fame. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
image was of such power that the door of the
church in which it stood was open at all hours to all comers, and no human
hand could close it. Dovercourt therefore became a place of great and
lucrative pilgrimage, much resorted to by the neighbours on all occasions
of difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its powers are submitted to trial,</div>

<p>Now it happened that within the circuit of a few miles there lived four
young men, to whom the virtues of the rood had become greatly questionable.
If it could work miracles, it must be capable, so they thought, of
protecting its own substance; and they agreed to apply a practical test
which would determine the extent of its abilities. Accordingly (about the
time of Bainham's first imprisonment), Robert King of Dedham, Robert
Debenham of Eastbergholt, Nicholas Marsh of Dedham, and Robert Gardiner of
Dedham, "their consciences being burdened to see the honour of Almighty God
so blasphemed by such an idol," started off "on a wondrous goodly night" in
February, with hard frost and a clear full moon, ten miles across the
wolds, to the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And are found unequal to the emergency.</div>

<p>The door was open as the legend declared; but nothing daunted, they entered
bravely, and lifting down the "idol" from its shrine, with its coat and
shoes, and the store of tapers which were kept for the services, they
carried it on their shoulders for a quarter of a mile from the place where
it had stood, "without any resistance of the said idol." There setting it
on the ground, they struck a light, fastened the tapers to the body, and
<span class="sidenote">The rood is burnt.</span>
with the help of them, sacrilegiously burnt the image down to a heap of
ashes; the old dry wood "blazing so brimly," that it lighted them a full
mile of their way
home.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
For this night's performance, which, if the devil is the father of lies,
was a stroke of honest work against him and his family, the world rewarded
these men after the usual fashion. One of them, Robert Gardiner, escaped
<span class="sidenote">Execution of three of the perpetrators.</span>
the search which was made, and disappeared till better times; the remaining
three were swinging in chains six months later on the scene of their
exploit. Their fate was perhaps inevitable. Men who dare to be the first in
great movements are ever self-immolated victims. But I suppose that it was
better for them to be bleaching on their gibbets, than crawling at the feet
of a wooden rood, and believing it to be God.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>These were the first Paladins of the Reformation, the knights who slew the
<span class="sidenote">The Protestant Paladins.</span>
dragons and the enchanters, and made the earth habitable for common flesh
and blood. They were rarely, as we have said, men of great ability, still
more rarely men of "wealth and station"; but men rather of clear senses and
honest hearts. Tyndal was a remarkable person, and so Clark and Frith
promised to become; but the two last were cut off before they had found
scope to show themselves; and Tyndal remaining abroad, lay outside the
battle which was being fought in England, doing noble work, indeed, and
ending as the rest ended, with earning a martyr's crown; but taking no part
<span class="sidenote">The two greatest men on the side of the Reformation.</span>
in the actual struggle except with his pen. As yet but two men of the
highest order of power were on the side of Protestantism&mdash;Latimer and
Cromwell. Of them we have already said something; but the time was now fast
coming when they were to step forward, pressed by circumstances which could
no longer dispense with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
them, into scenes of far wider activity; and the
present seems a fitting occasion to give some closer account of their
history. When the breach with the pope was made irreparable, and the papal
party at home had assumed an attitude of suspended insurrection, the
fortunes of the Protestants entered into a new phase. The persecution
ceased; and those who but lately were carrying fagots in the streets, or
<span class="sidenote">The approaching revulsion, and the use which was made of it.</span>
hiding for their lives, passed at once by a sudden alternation into the
sunshine of political favour. The summer was but a brief one, followed soon
by returning winter; but Cromwell and Latimer had together caught the
moment as it went by; and before it was over, a work had been done in
England which, when it was accomplished once, was accomplished for ever.
The conservative party recovered their power, and abused it as before; but
the chains of the nation were broken, and no craft of kings or priests or
statesmen could weld the magic links again.</p>

<p>It is a pity that of two persons to whom England owes so deep a debt, we
can piece together such scanty biographies. I must attempt, however, to
give some outline of the little which is known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The family of Hugh Latimer. His father a Leicestershire yeoman.</div>

<p>The father of Latimer was a solid English yeoman, of Thurcaston, in
Leicestershire. "He had no lands of his own," but he rented a farm "of four
pounds by the year," on which "he tilled so much as kept half a dozen men;"
"he had walk for a hundred sheep, and meadow ground for thirty cows."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
The world prospered with him; he was able to save money for his son's
education and his daughters' portions; but he was free-handed and
hospitable; he kept open house for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> poor neighbours; and he was a good
citizen, too, for "he did find the king a harness with himself and his
horse," ready to do battle for his country, if occasion called. His family
were brought up "in godliness and the fear of the Lord;" and in all points
the old Latimer seems to have been a worthy, sound, upright man, of the
true English mettle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reformer born about 1490,</div>

<p>There were several children.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The Reformer was born about 1490, some
five years after the usurper Richard had been killed at Bosworth. Bosworth
being no great distance from Thurcaston, Latimer the father is likely to
have been present in the battle, on one side or the other,&mdash;the right side
in those times it was no easy matter to choose,&mdash;but he became a good
servant of the new government,&mdash;and the little Hugh, when a boy of seven
<span class="sidenote">And brought up in the farmhouse as a brave
English boy.</span>
years old, helped to buckle<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
on his armour for him, "when he went to
Blackheath field."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Being a soldier himself, the old gentleman was
careful to give his sons, whatever else he gave them, a sound soldier's
training. "He was diligent," says Latimer, "to teach me to shoot with the
bow: he taught me how to draw, how to lay my body in the bow&mdash;not to draw
with strength of arm, as other nations do, but with the strength of the
body. I had my bows bought me according to my age and strength; as I
increased in these, my bows were made bigger and
bigger."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Under this
education, and in the wholesome atmosphere of the farmhouse, the boy
prospered well; and by and bye, showing signs of promise, he

his father transferred him to

<div class="sidenote">Is elected fellow of Clare Hall, and becomes a divinity
student.</div>

<p>He was soon known at the university as a sober, hard-working student. At
nineteen, he was elected fellow of Clare Hall; at twenty, he took his
degree, and became a student in divinity, when he accepted quietly, like a
sensible man, the doctrines which he had been brought up to believe. At the
time when Henry VIII. was writing against Luther, Latimer was fleshing his
maiden sword in an attack upon Melancthon;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and he remained, he said,
<span class="sidenote">Converted from "the shadow of death" by Bilney.</span>
till he was thirty, "in darkness and the shadow of death." About this time
he became acquainted with Bilney, whom he calls "the instrument whereby God
called him to knowledge." In Bilney, doubtless, he found a sound
instructor; but a careful reader of his sermons will see traces of a
teaching for which he was indebted to no human master. His deepest
<span class="sidenote">Sources of Latimer's knowledge, as evidenced in his
sermons.</span>
knowledge was that which stole upon him unconsciously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>through the
experience of life and the world. His words are like the clear impression
of a seal; the account and the result of observations, taken first hand, on
the condition of the English men and women of his time, in all ranks and
classes, from the palace to the prison. He shows large acquaintance with
books; with the Bible, most of all; with patristic divinity and school
divinity; and history, sacred and profane: but if this had been all, he
would not have been the Latimer of the Reformation, and the Church of
England would not, perhaps, have been here to-day. Like the physician, to
whom a year of practical experience in a hospital teaches more than a life
of closet study, Latimer learnt the mental disorders of his age in the age
itself; and the secret of that art no other man, however good, however
wise, could have taught him. He was not an echo, but a voice; and he drew
his thoughts fresh from the fountain&mdash;from the facts of the era in which
God had placed him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His early reputation as a preacher at Cambridge.</div>

<p>He became early famous as a preacher at Cambridge, from the first, "a
seditious fellow," as a noble lord called him in later life, highly
troublesome to unjust persons in authority. "None, except the stiff-necked
and uncircumcised, ever went away from his preaching, it was said, without
being affected with high detestation of sin, and moved to all godliness and
virtue."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
And, in his audacious simplicity, he addressed himself always
<span class="sidenote">Personal character of his addresses.</span>
to his individual hearers, giving his words a personal application, and
often addressing men by name. This habit brought him first into difficulty
in 1525. He was preaching before the university,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>sity
when the Bishop of Ely
came into the church, being curious to hear him. He paused till the bishop
was seated; and when he recommenced, he changed his subject, and drew an
<span class="sidenote">He offends the Bishop of Ely.</span>
ideal picture of a prelate as a prelate ought to be; the features of which,
though he did not say so, were strikingly unlike those of his auditor. The
bishop complained to Wolsey, who sent for Latimer, and inquired what he had
said. Latimer repeated the substance of his sermon; and other conversation
then followed, which showed Wolsey very clearly the nature of the person
with whom he was speaking. No eye saw more rapidly than the cardinal's the
difference between a true man and an impostor; and he replied to the Bishop
of Ely's accusations by granting the offender a licence to preach in any
<span class="sidenote">Wolsey's judgment on the bishop's complaint.</span>
church in England. "If the Bishop of Ely cannot abide such doctrine as you
have here repeated," he said, "you shall preach it to his beard, let him
say what he will."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical character of Latimer's mind, which protected him from
speculative difficulties.</div>

<p>Thus fortified, Latimer pursued his way, careless of the university
authorities, and probably defiant of them. He was still orthodox in points
of theoretic belief. His mind was practical rather than speculative, and he
was slow in arriving at conclusions which had no immediate bearing upon
action. No charge could be fastened upon him, definitely criminal; and he
was too strong to be crushed by that compendious tyranny which treated as
an act of heresy the exposure of imposture or delinquency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Wolsey's fall, he is appointed royal chaplain.</div>

<p>On Wolsey's fall, however, he would have certainly been silenced: if he had
fallen into the hands of Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> Thomas More, he would have perhaps been
prematurely sacrificed. But, fortunately, he found a fresh protector in the
king. Henry heard of him, sent for him, and, with instinctive recognition
of his character, appointed him one of the royal chaplains. He now left
Cambridge and removed to Windsor, but only to treat his royal patron as
freely as he had treated the Cambridge doctors,&mdash;not with any absence of
respect, for he was most respectful, but with that highest respect which
dares to speak unwelcome truth where the truth seems to be forgotten. He
was made chaplain in 1530&mdash;during the new persecution, for which Henry was
<span class="sidenote">Latimer addresses Henry in behalf of the Protestants.</span>
responsible by a more than tacit acquiescence. Latimer, with no authority
but his own conscience, and the strong certainty that he was on God's side,
threw himself between the spoilers and their prey, and wrote to the king,
protesting against the injustice which was crushing the truest men in his
dominions. The letter is too long to insert; the close of it may show how a
poor priest could dare to address the imperious Henry VIII.:</p>

<p>"I pray to God that your Grace may take heed of the worldly wisdom which is
foolishness before God; that you may do that [which] God commandeth, and
not that [which] seemeth good in your own sight, without the word of God;
that your Grace may be found acceptable in his sight, and one of the
members of his church; and according to the office that he hath called your
Grace unto, you may be found a faithful minister of his gifts, and not a
defender of his faith: for he will not have it defended by man or man's
power, but by his word only, by the which he hath evermore defended it, and
that by a way far above man's power or reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wherefore, gracious king, remember yourself; have pity upon your soul; and
think that the day is even at hand when you shall give account for your
office, and of the blood that hath been shed by your sword. In which day,
that your Grace may stand steadfastly, and not be ashamed, but be clear and
ready in your reckoning, and have (as they say), your <i>quietus est</i> sealed
with the blood of our Saviour Christ, which only serveth at that day, is my
daily prayer to Him that suffered death for our sins, which also prayeth to
his Father for grace for us continually; to whom be all honour and praise
for ever. Amen. The Spirit of God preserve your Grace."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His intercession was ineffectual,</div>

<p>These words, which conclude an address of almost unexampled grandeur, are
unfortunately of no interest to us, except as illustrating the character of
the priest who wrote them, and the king to whom they were written. The hand
of the persecutor was not stayed. The rack and the lash and the stake
continued to claim their victims. So far it was labour in vain. But the
letter remains, to speak for ever for the courage of Latimer; and to speak
something, too, for a prince that could respect the nobleness of the poor
yeoman's son, who dared in such a cause to write to him as a man to a man.
<span class="sidenote">But earned the increased regard of the king.</span>
To have written at all in such a strain was as brave a step as was ever
deliberately ventured. Like most brave acts, it did not go unrewarded; for
Henry remained ever after, however widely divided from him in opinion, his
unshaken friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He retires from the court to West Kingston, but preaches widely
about the country.</div>

<p>In 1531, the king gave him the living of West Kingston, in Wiltshire, where
for a time he now retired. Yet it was but a partial rest. He had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> special
licence as a preacher from Cambridge, which continued to him (with the
king's express
sanction)<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
the powers which he had received from Wolsey.
He might preach in any diocese to which he was invited; and the repose of a
country parish could not be long allowed in such stormy times to Latimer.
He had bad health, being troubled with headache, pleurisy, colic, stone;
his bodily constitution meeting feebly the demands which he was forced to
make upon it.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
But he struggled on, travelling up and down to London,
to Kent, to Bristol, wherever opportunity called him; marked for
destruction by the bishops, if he was betrayed into an imprudent word, and
himself living in constant expectation of
death.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He is cited before Stokesley,</div>

<p>At length the Bishop of London believed that Latimer was in his power. He
had preached at St. Abb's, in the city, "at the request of a company of
merchants,"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
in the beginning of the winter of 1531; and soon after his
return to his living, he was informed that he was to be cited before
Stokesley. His friends in the neighbourhood wrote to him, evidently in
<span class="sidenote">And expects death.</span>
great alarm, and more anxious that he might clear himself than expecting
that he would be able to do so;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
he himself, indeed, had almost made up
his mind that the end was
coming.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">January 10.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
The citation was delayed for a few weeks. It was issued at last, on the
10th of January,
1531-2,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
and was served by Sir Walter Hungerford, of
Farley.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Method of prosecution in cases of suspected heresy.</span>
The offences with which he was charged were certain "excesses
and irregularities" not specially defined; and the practice of the bishops
in such cases was not to confine the prosecution to the acts committed, but
to draw up a series of articles, on which it was presumed that the
orthodoxy of the accused person was open to suspicion, and to question him
separately upon each. Latimer was first examined by Stokesley; subsequently
at various times by the bishops collectively; and finally, when certain
<span class="sidenote">The charge against Latimer submitted to convocation.</span>
formulas had been submitted to him, which he refused to sign, his case was
transferred to convocation. The convocation, as we know, were then in
difficulty with their premunire; they had consoled themselves in their
sorrow with burning the body of Tracy; and they would gladly have taken
further comfort by burning Latimer.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> He was submitted to the closest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cross-questionings, in the hope that he would commit himself. They felt
that he was the most dangerous person to them in the kingdom, and they
laboured with unusual patience to ensure his conviction.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> With a common
person they would have rapidly succeeded. But Latimer was in no haste to be
<span class="sidenote">The efforts for his conviction baffled by his skill in reply.</span>
a martyr; he would be martyred patiently when the time was come for
martyrdom; but he felt that no one ought "to consent to die," as long as he
could honestly live;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and he baffled the episcopal inquisitors with
their own weapons. He has left a most curious account of one of his
interviews with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latimer before the bishops.</div>

<p>"I was once in examination," he says,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> "before five or six bishops,
where I had much turmoiling. Every week, thrice, I came to examination, and
many snares and traps were laid to get something. Now, God knoweth, I was
ignorant of the law; but that God gave me answer and wisdom what I should
speak. It was God indeed, for else I had never escaped them. At the last, I
was brought forth to be examined into a chamber hanged with arras, where I
was before wont to be examined, but now, at this time, the chamber was
somewhat altered: for whereas before there was wont ever to be a fire in
the chimney,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> now the fire was taken away, and an arras hanging hanged
over the chimney; and the table stood near the chimney's end, so that I
stood between the table and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> the chimney's end. There was among these
bishops that examined me one with whom I had been very familiar, and took
him for my great friend, an aged man, and he sate next the table end. Then,
among all other questions, he put forth one, a very subtle and crafty one,
and such one indeed as I could not think so great danger in. And when I
would make answer, 'I pray you, Master Latimer,' said he, 'speak out; I am
very thick of hearing, and here be many that sit far off.' I marvelled at
this, that I was bidden to speak out, and began to misdeem, and gave an ear
to the chimney; and, sir, there I heard a pen walking in the chimney,
behind the cloth. They had appointed one there to write all mine answers;
for they made sure work that I should not start from them: there was no
starting from them: God was my good Lord, and gave me answer; I could never
else have escaped it. The question was this: 'Master Latimer, do you not
think, on your conscience, that you have been suspected of heresy?'&mdash;a
subtle question&mdash;a very subtle question. There was no holding of peace
would serve. To hold my peace had been to grant myself faulty. To answer
was every way full of danger. But God, which hath always given me answer,
helped me, or else I could never have escaped it. <i>Ostendite mihi numisma
cens&ucirc;s.</i> Shew me, said he, a penny of the tribute money. They laid snares
to destroy him, but he overturneth them in their own
traps."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The bishops, however, were not men who were nice in their adherence to the
laws; and it would have gone ill with Latimer, notwithstanding his
dialectic ability. He was excommunicated and imprisoned, and would soon
have fallen into worse extremities; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
at the last moment he appealed to
<span class="sidenote">He appeals to the king, and is saved.</span>
the king, and the king, who knew his value, would not allow him to be
sacrificed. He had refused to subscribe the articles proposed to
him.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Henry intimated to the convocation that it was not his pleasure that the
matter should be pressed further; they were to content themselves with a
general submission, which should be made to the archbishop, without
exacting more special acknowledgments. This was the reward to Latimer for
his noble letter. He was absolved, and returned to his parish, though
snatched as a brand out of the fire.</p>

<p>Soon after, the tide turned, and the Reformation entered into a new phase.</p>

<p>Such is a brief sketch of the life of Hugh Latimer, to the time when it
blended with the broad stream of English history. With respect to the other
very great man whom the exigencies of the state called to power
simultaneously with him, our information is far less satisfactory. Though
our knowledge of Latimer's early story comes to us in fragments only, yet
there are certain marks in it by which the outline can be determined with
<span class="sidenote">Thomas Cromwell.</span>
certainty. A cloud rests over the youth and early manhood of Thomas
Cromwell, through which, only at intervals, we catch glimpses of authentic
facts; and these few fragments of reality seem rather to belong to a
romance than to the actual life of a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His father, one of the Cromwells of Lincolnshire,
dies early.</div>

<p>Cromwell, the malleus monachorum, was of good English family, belonging to
the Cromwells of Lincolnshire. One of these, probably a younger brother,
moved up to London and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
conducted an ironfoundry, or other business of that
description, at Putney. He married a lady of respectable connexions, of
whom we know only that she was sister of the wife of a gentleman in
Derbyshire, but whose name does not
appear.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
The old Cromwell dying<span class="sidenote">His mother re-marries, and her son becomes a
vagabond.</span>
early, the widow was remarried, to a cloth-merchant; and the child of the
first husband, who made himself so great a name in English story, met with
the reputed fortune of a stepson, and became a vagabond in the wide world.
The chart of his course wholly fails us. One day in later life he shook by
the hand an old bellringer at Sion House before a crowd of courtiers, and
told them that "this man's father had given him many a dinner in his
necessities." And a strange random account is given by Foxe of his having
<span class="sidenote">Wild story of his journey to Rome.</span>
joined a party in an expedition to Rome to obtain a renewal from the pope
of certain immunities and indulgences for the town of Boston; a story which
derives some kind of credibility from its connexion with Lincolnshire, but
is full of incoherence and unlikelihood. Following still the popular
<span class="sidenote">His Italian wanderings.</span>
legend, we find him in the autumn of 1515 a ragged stripling at the door of
Frescobaldi's banking-house in Florence, begging for help. Frescobaldi had
an establishment in
London,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
with a large connexion there; and seeing
an English face, and seemingly an honest one, he asked the boy who and what
he was. "I am, sir," quoth he, "of England, and my name is Thomas Cromwell;
<span class="sidenote">The Florentine banker.</span>
my father is a poor man, and by occupation a clothshearer; I am strayed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
from my country, and am now come into Italy with the camp of Frenchmen that
were overthrown at Garigliano, where I was page to a footman, carrying
after him his pike and burganet." Something in the boy's manner was said to
have attracted the banker's interest; he took him into his house, and after
keeping him there as long as he desired to stay, he gave him a horse and
sixteen ducats to help him home to
England.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Foxe is the first English
authority for the story; and Foxe took it from Bandello, the novelist; but
it is confirmed by, or harmonizes with, a sketch of Cromwell's early life
in a letter of Chappuys, the imperial ambassador, to Chancellor Granvelle.
"Master Cromwell," wrote Chappuys in 1535, "is the son of a poor
blacksmith, who lived in a small village four miles from London, and is
buried in a common grave in the parish churchyard. In his youth, for some
offence, he was imprisoned, and had to leave the country. He went to
Flanders, and thence to Rome and other places in
Italy."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Returning to England, he married the daughter of a woollen-dealer, and
became a partner in the business, where he amassed or inherited a
considerable fortune.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Circumstances afterwards brought him, while
still young, in contact with Wolsey, who discovered his merit, took him
<span class="sidenote">He finds his way into the service of Wolsey.</span>
into service, and in 1525 employed him in the most important work of
visiting and breaking up the small monasteries, which the pope had granted
for the foundation of the new colleges. He was engaged with this business
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
for two years, and was so efficient that he obtained an unpleasant
notoriety, and complaints of his conduct found their way to the king.
Nothing came of these complaints, however, and Cromwell remained with the
cardinal till his
fall.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cromwell's noble conduct on Wolsey's fall.</div>

<p>It was then that the truly noble nature which was in him showed itself. He
accompanied his master through his dreary confinement at
Esher,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> doing
all that man could do to soften the outward wretchedness of it; and at the
meeting of parliament, in which he obtained a seat, he rendered him a still
more gallant service. The Lords had passed a bill of impeachment against
Wolsey, violent, vindictive, and malevolent. It was to be submitted to the
Commons, and Cromwell prepared to attempt an opposition.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Cavendish has
left a most characteristic description of his leaving Esher at this trying
time. A cheerless November evening was closing in with rain and storm.
<span class="sidenote">Scene at Esher.</span>
Wolsey was broken down with sorrow and sickness; and had been unusually
tried by parting with his retinue, whom he had sent home, as unwilling to
keep them attached any longer to his fallen fortunes. When they were all
gone, "My lord," says Cavendish, "returned to his chamber, lamenting the
departure of his servants, making his moan unto Master Cromwell, who
<span class="sidenote">Cromwell's common saying, that he would either
make or mar.</span>
comforted him the best he could, and desired my lord give him leave to go
to London, where he would either make or mar before he came again; which
was always his common saying. Then after long communication with my lord in
secret, he departed, and took his horse and rode to London; at whose
departing I was by, whom he bade farewell, and said, ye shall hear shortly
of me, and if I speed well I will not fail to be here again within these
two days."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
He did speed well. "After two days he came again with a
much pleasanter countenance, and meeting with me before he came to my lord,
said unto me, that he had adventured to put in his foot where he trusted
shortly to be better regarded or all were done." He had stopped the
<span class="sidenote">He defeats the attempted impeachment of Wolsey in the House of
Commons,</span>
progress of the impeachment in the Lower House, and was answering the
articles one by one. In the evening he rode down to Esher for instructions.
In the morning he was again at his place in Parliament; and he conducted
the defence so skilfully, that finally he threw out the bill, saved Wolsey,
and himself "grew into such estimation in every man's opinion, for his
honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> behaviour in his master's cause, that he was esteemed the most
faithfullest servant, [and] was of all men greatly commended."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And passes into the service of the king.</div>

<p>Henry admired his chivalry, and perhaps his talent. The loss of Wolsey had
left him without any very able man, unless we may consider Sir Thomas More
such, upon his council, and he could not calculate on More for support in
his anti-Roman policy; he was glad, therefore, to avail himself of the
service of a man who had given so rare a proof of fidelity, and who had
been trained by the ablest statesman of the age.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>To Wolsey Cromwell could render no more service except as a friend, and his
warm friend he remained to the last. He became the king's secretary,
representing the government in the House of Commons, and was at once on the
high road to power. I cannot call him ambitious; an ambitious man would
scarcely have pursued so refined a policy, or have calculated on the
admiration which he gained by adhering to a fallen minister. He did not
seek greatness,&mdash;greatness rather sought him as the man in England most fit
to bear it. His business was to prepare the measures which were to be
submitted to Parliament by the government. His influence, therefore, grew
necessarily with the rapidity with which events were ripening; and when the
conclusive step was taken, and the king was married, the virtual conduct of
the Reformation passed into his hands. His Protestant tendencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> were
unknown as yet, perhaps, even to his own conscience; nor to the last could
he arrive at any certain speculative convictions. He was drawn towards the
Protestants as he rose into power by the integrity of his nature, which
compelled him to trust only those who were honest like himself.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The origin of the word Lollards has been always a disputed
question. I conceive it to be from Lolium. They were the "tares" in the
corn of Catholicism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> 25 Ed. III. stat. 4. A clause in the preamble of this act
bears a significantly Erastian complexion: <i>come seinte Eglise estoit
founde en estat de prelacie deins le royaulme Dengleterre par le dit Roi et
ses progenitours, et countes, barons, et nobles de ce Royaulme et lours
ancestres, pour eux et le poeple enfourmer de la lei Dieu.</i> If the Church
of England was held to have been founded not by the successors of the
Apostles, but by the king and the nobles, the claim of Henry VIII to the
supremacy was precisely in the spirit of the constitution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> 38 Ed. III. stat. 2; 3 Ric. II. cap. 3; 12 Ric. II. cap. 15;
13 Ric. II. stat. 2. The first of these acts contains a paragraph which
shifts the blame from the popes themselves to the officials of the Roman
courts. The statute is said to have been enacted en eide et confort du pape
qui moult sovent a estee trublez par tieles et semblables clamours et
impetracions, et qui y meist voluntiers covenable remedie, si sa seyntetee
estoit sur ces choses enfournee. I had regarded this passage as a fiction
of courtesy like that of the Long Parliament who levied troops in the name
of Charles I. The suspicious omission of the clause, however, in the
translation of the statutes which was made in the later years of Henry
VIII. justifies an interpretation more favourable to the intentions of the
popes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> There is no better test of the popular opinion of a man than
the character assigned to him on the stage; and till the close of the
sixteenth century Sir John Oldcastle remained the profligate buffoon of
English comedy. Whether in life he bore the character so assigned to him, I
am unable to say. The popularity of Henry V., and the splendour of his
French wars served no doubt to colour all who had opposed him with a
blacker shade than they deserved: but it is almost certain that Shakspeare,
though not intending Falstaff as a portrait of Oldcastle, thought of him as
he was designing the character; and it is altogether certain that by the
London public Falstaff was supposed to represent Oldcastle. We can hardly
suppose that such an expression as "my old lad of the castle" should be
accidental; and in the epilogue to the Second Part of <i>Henry the Fourth</i>,
when promising to reintroduce Falstaff once more, Shakspeare says, "where
for anything I know he shall die of the sweat, for Oldcastle died a martyr,
and this is not the man." He had, therefore, certainly been supposed to <i>be
the man</i>, and Falstaff represented the English conception of the character
of the Lollard hero. I should add, however, that Dean Milman, who has
examined the records which remain to throw light on the character of this
remarkable person with elaborate care and ability, concludes emphatically
in his favour.</p></div>

On Dec. 2d, 1525, Edward Lee, afterwards Archbishop of York, then king's
almoner, and on a mission into Spain, wrote from Bordeaux to warn Henry.
The letter is instructive:
</p><p>
"Please your Highness to understand that I am certainly informed as I
passed in this country, that an Englishman, your subject, at the
solicitation and instance of Luther, with whom he is, hath translated the
New Testament into English; and within few days intendeth to return with
the same imprinted into England. I need not to advertise your Grace what
infection and danger may ensue hereby if it be not withstanded. This is the
next way to fulfil your realm with Lutherians. For all Luther's perverse
opinions be grounded upon bare words of Scripture, not well taken, ne
understanded which your Grace hath opened in sundry places of your royal
book. All our forefathers, governors of the Church of England, hath with
all diligence forbid and eschewed publication of English Bibles, as
appeareth in constitutions provincial of the Church of England. Nowe, sire,
as God hath endued your Grace with Christian courage to sett forth the
standard against these Philistines and to vanquish them, so I doubt not but
that he will assist your Grace to prosecute and perform the same&mdash;that is,
to undertread them that they shall not now lift up their heads; which they
endeavour by means of English Bibles. They know what hurt such books hath
done in your realm in times past."&mdash;Edward Lee to Henry VIII.: Ellis, third
series, Vol. II. p. 71.</p></div>

and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought
before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and
the gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you. And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death; and
the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my

shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which
is in heaven. Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
before my Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to send peace

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Dr. Maitland, who has an indifferent opinion of the early
Protestants, especially on the point of veracity, brings forward this
assertion of Dalaber as an illustration of what he considers their
recklessness. It seems obvious, however, that a falsehood of this kind is
something different in kind from what we commonly mean by unveracity, and
has no affinity with it. I do not see my way to a conclusion; but I am
satisfied that Dr. Maitland's strictures are unjust. If Garret was taken,
he was in danger of a cruel death, and his escape could only be made
possible by throwing the bloodhounds off the scent. A refusal to answer
would not have been sufficient; and the general laws by which our conduct
is ordinarily to be directed cannot be made so universal in their
application as to meet all contingencies. It is a law that we may not
strike or kill other men, but occasions rise in which we may innocently do
both. I may kill a man in defence of my own life or my friend's life, or
even of my friend's property; and surely the circumstances which dispense
with obedience to one law may dispense equally with obedience to another.
<i>If</i> I may kill a man to prevent him from robbing my friend, why may I not
deceive a man to save my friend from being barbarously murdered? It is
possible that the highest morality would forbid me to do either. I am
unable to see why, if the first be permissible, the second should be a
crime. Rahab of Jericho did the same thing which Dalaber did, and on that
very ground was placed in the catalogue of saints.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> The circumstances are curious. Philips begged that he might
have the benefit of the king's writ of corpus cum caus&acirc;, and be brought to
the bar of the House of Commons, where the Bishop of London should be
subp&oelig;naed to meet him. [Petition of Thomas Philips: <i>Rolls House MS.</i>]
The Commons did not venture on so strong a measure; but a digest of the
petition was sent to the Upper House, that the bishop might have an
opportunity of reply. The Lords refused to receive or consider the case:
they replied that it was too "frivolous an affair" for so grave an
assembly, and that they could not discuss it. [<i>Lords' Journals</i>, Vol. I.
p. 66.] A deputation of the Commons then waited privately upon the bishop,
and being of course anxious to ascertain whether Philips had given a true
version of what had passed, they begged him to give some written
explanation of his conduct, which might be read in the Commons' House.
[<i>Lords' Journals</i>, Vol. I. p. 71.] The request was reasonable, and we
cannot doubt that, if explanation had been possible, the bishop would not
have failed to offer it; but he preferred to shield himself behind the
judgment of the Lords. The Lords, he said, had decided that the matter was
too frivolous for their own consideration; and without their permission, he
might not set a precedent of responsibility to the Commons by answering
their questions.
</p><p>
This conduct met with the unanimous approval of the Peers. [<i>Lords'
Journals</i>, Vol. I. p. 71. Omnes proceres tam spirituales quam temporales
un&acirc; voce dicebant, quod non consentaneum fuit aliquem procerum pr&aelig;dictorum
alicui in eo loco responsurum.] The demand for explanation was treated as a
breach of privilege, and the bishop was allowed to remain silent. But the
time was passed for conduct of this kind to be allowed to triumph. If the
bishop could not or would not justify himself, his victim might at least be
released from unjust imprisonment. The case was referred to the king and by
the king and the House of Commons Philips was set at liberty.</p></div>

"I was once called to one of my kinsfolk," he says ("it was at that time
when I had taken my degree at Cambridge); I was called, I say, to one of my
kinsfolk which was very sick, and died immediately after my coming. Now,
there was an old cousin of mine, which, after the man was dead, gave me a
wax candle in my hand, and commanded me to make certain crosses over him
that was dead; for she thought the devil should run away by and bye. Now, I
took the candle, but I could not cross him as she would have me to do; for
I had never seen it before. She, perceiving I could not do it, with great
anger took the candle out of my hand, saying, 'It is pity that thy father
spendeth so much money upon thee;' and so she took the candle, and crossed
and blessed him; so that he was sure enough."&mdash;Latimer's <i>Sermons</i>, p.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_139_139" id="Footnote_139_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139_139"><span class="label">[139]</span></a> Are we to believe Foxe's story that Cromwell was with the
Duke of Bourbon at the storming of Rome in May, 1527? See Foxe, Vol. V. p.
365. He was with Wolsey in January, 1527. See Ellis, third series, Vol. II.
p. 117. And he was again with him early in 1528. Is it likely that he was
in Italy on such an occasion in the interval? Foxe speaks of it as one of
the random exploits of Cromwell's youth, which is obviously untrue; and the
natural impression which we gather is, that he was confusing the expedition
of the Duke of Bourbon with some earlier campaign. On the other hand Foxe's
authority was Cranmer, who was likely to know the truth: and it is not
impossible that, in the critical state of Italian politics, the English
government might have desired to have some confidential agent in the Duke
of Bourbon's camp. Cromwell, with his knowledge of Italy and Italian, and
his adventurous ability, was a likely man to have been sent on such an
employment; and the story gains additional probability from another legend
about him, that he once saved the life of Sir John Russell, in some secret
affair at Bologna. See Foxe, Vol. V. p. 367. Now, although Sir John Russell
had been in Italy several times before (he was at the Battle of Pavia, and
had been employed in various diplomatic missions), and Cromwell might thus
have rendered him the service in question on an earlier occasion, yet he
certainly was in the Papal States, on a most secret and dangerous mission,
in the months preceding the capture of Rome. <i>State Papers</i>, Vol. VI. p.
560, &amp;c. The probabilities may pass for what they are worth till further
discovery.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="chaptsubhead">THE LAST EFFORTS OF DIPLOMACY.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">I have</span> now to resume the thread of the political history where it was
dropped at the sentence of divorce pronounced by Cranmer, and the
coronation of the new queen. The effect was about to be ascertained of
these bold measures upon Europe; and of what their effect would be, only so
much could be foretold with certainty, that the time for trifling was past,
and the pope and Francis of France would be compelled to declare their true
intentions. If these intentions were honest, the subordination of England
to the papacy might be still preserved in a modified form. The papal
jurisdiction was at end, but the spiritual supremacy of the Bishop of Rome,
with a diminished but considerable revenue attached to it, remained
unaffected; and it was for the pope to determine whether, by fulfilling at
last his original engagements, he would preserve these remnants of his
power and privileges, or boldly take up the gage, excommunicate his
disobedient subjects, and attempt by force to bring them back to their
allegiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 22.</div>

<p>The news of what had been done did not take him wholly by surprise. It was
known at Brussels at the end of April that the king had married. The queen
regent<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
spoke of it to the ambassador
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
sternly and significantly, not
concealing her expectation of the mortal resentment which would be felt by
her brothers;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
and the information was forwarded with the least
<span class="sidenote">The king's marriage compels Clement to declare
himself.</span>
possible delay to the cardinals of the imperial faction at Rome. The true
purposes which underlay the contradiction of Clement's language are
undiscoverable. Perhaps in the past winter he had been acting out a deep
intrigue&mdash;perhaps he was drifting between rival currents, and yielded in
any or all directions as the alternate pressure varied; yet whatever had
been the meaning of his language, whether it was a scheme to deceive Henry,
or was the expression only of weakness and good-nature desiring to avoid a
quarrel to the latest moment, the decisive step which had been taken in the
marriage, even though it was nominally undivulged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> obliged him to choose
his course and openly adhere to it. After the experience of the past, there
could be no doubt what that course would be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 12. The king is cited to appear at Rome.</div>

<p>On the 12th of May a citation was issued against the King of England,
summoning him to appear by person or proxy at a stated day. It had been
understood that no step of such a kind was to be taken before the meeting
of the pope and Francis; Bennet, therefore, Henry's faithful secretary,
hastily inquired the meaning of this measure. The pope told him that it
could not be avoided, and the language which he used revealed to the
English agent the inevitable future. The king, he said, had defied the
inhibitory brief which had been lately issued, and had incurred
excommunication; the imperialists insisted that he should be proceeded
against for contempt, and that the excommunication should at once be
pronounced. However great might be his own personal reluctance, it was not
possible for him to remain passive; and if he declined to resort at once to

the more extreme exercise of his power, the hesitation was merely until the
emperor was prepared to enforce the censures of the church with the strong
hand. It stood not "with his honour to execute such censures," he said,
"and the same not to be
regarded."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
But there was no wish to spare
Henry; and if Francis could be detached from his ally, and if the condition
of the rest of Christendom became such as to favour the enterprise, England
might evidently look for the worst which the pope, with the Catholic
powers, could execute. If the papal court was roused into so menacing a
mood by the mere intimation of the secret marriage, it was easy to foresee
what would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ensue when the news arrived of the proceedings at Dunstable.
Bennet entreated that the process should be delayed till the interview; but
the pope answered coldly that he had done his best and could do no more;
the imperialists were urgent, and he saw no reason to refuse their
petition.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
This was Clement's usual language, but there was something
<span class="sidenote">The pope's resolution and the explanation of it.</span>
peculiar in his manner. He had been often violent, but he had never shown
resolution, and the English agents were perplexed. The mystery was soon
explained. He had secured himself on the side of France; and Francis, who
at Calais had told Henry that his negotiations with the see of Rome were
solely for the interests of England, that for Henry's sake he was marrying
his son into a family beneath him in rank, that Henry's divorce was to form
the especial subject of his conference with the pope, had consented to
allow these dangerous questions to sink into a secondary place, and had
relinquished his intention, if he had ever seriously entertained it, of
becoming an active party in the English quarrel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delay of the interview between the pope and Francis.</div>

<p>The long talked-of interview was still delayed. First it was to have taken
place in the winter, then in the spring; June was the date last fixed for
it, and now Bennet had to inform the king that it would not take place
before September; and that, from the terms of a communication which had
just passed between the parties who were to meet, the subjects discussed at
the conference would not be those which
<span class="sidenote">The true purposes of that interview.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
he had been led to expect.
Francis, in answer to a question from the pope, had specified three things
which he proposed particularly to "intreat." The first concerned the
defence of Christendom against the Turks, the second concerned the general
council, and the third concerned "the extinction of the Lutheran
sect."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> These were the points which the Most Christian king was anxious
to discuss with the pope. For the latter good object especially, "he would
devise and treat for the provision of an army." In the King of England's
cause, he trusted "some means might be found whereby it might be
compounded;"<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> but if persuasion failed, there was no fear lest he
should have recourse to any other method.</p>

<p>It was this which had given back to the pope his courage. It was this which
Bennet had now to report to Henry. The French alliance, it was too likely,
would prove a broken reed, and pierce the hand that leant upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probable isolation of England.</div>

<p>Henry knew the danger; but danger was not a very terrible thing either to
him or to his people. If he had conquered his own reluctance to risk a
schism in the church, he was not likely to yield to the fear of isolation;
and if there was something to alarm in the aspect of affairs, there was
also much to encourage. His parliament was united and resolute. His queen
was pregnant. The Nun of Kent had assigned him but a month to live after
his marriage; six months had passed, and he was alive and well; the
supernatural powers had not declared against him; and while safe with
respect to enmity from above, the earthly powers he could afford to defy.
When he finally divorced Queen Catherine, he must have foreseen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Policy of Francis.</span>
his present position at least as a possibility, and if not prepared for so
swift an apostasy in Francis, and if not yet wholly believing it, we may
satisfy ourselves he had never absolutely trusted a prince of metal so
questionable.</p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk was waiting at the French court, with a magnificent
embassy, to represent the English king at the interview. The arrival of the
pope had been expected in May. It was now delayed till September; and if
Clement came after all, it would be for objects in which England had but
small concern. It was better for England that there should be no meeting at
all, than a meeting to devise schemes for the massacre of Lutherans. Henry
therefore wrote to the Duke, telling him generally what he had heard from
Rome; he mentioned the three topics which he understood were to form the
matter of discussion; but he skilfully affected to regard them as having
originated with the imperialists, and not with the French king. In a long
paper of instructions, in which earnestness and irony were strangely
blended, he directed the ambassador to treat his good brother as if he were
still exclusively devoted to the interests of England; and to urge upon
him, on the ground of this fresh delay, that the interview should not take
place at all.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's instructions to the Duke of Norfolk to "disappoint
the interview."</div>

<p>"Our pleasure is," he wrote, "that ye shall say &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; that we be not a
little moved in our heart to see our good brother and us, being such
princes or Christendom, to be so handled with the pope, so much to our
dishonour, and to the pope's and the emperor's advancement; seeming to be
at the pope's commandment to come or tarry as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
he or his cardinals shall
appoint; and to depend upon his pleasure when to meet&mdash;that is to say, when
he list or never. If our good brother and we were either suitors to make
request, the obtaining whereof we did much set by, or had any particular
matter of advantage to entreat with him, these proceedings might be the
better tolerated; but our good brother having no particular matter of his
own, and being ... that [no] more glory nor surety could happen to the
<span class="sidenote">The "Three Articles" proposed for discussion will be wholly to
the advantage of the Imperialists</span>
emperour than to obtain the effect of the three articles moved by the pope
and his cardinals, we think it not convenient to attend the pleasure of the
pope, to go or to abyde. We could have been content to have received and
taken at the pope's hand, jointly with our good brother, pleasure and
friendship in our great cause; [but] on the other part, we cannot esteem
the pope's part so high, as to have our good brother an attendant suitor
therefore ... desiring him, therefore, in anywise to disappoint for his
part the said interview; and if he have already granted thereto&mdash;upon some
new good occasion, which he now undoubtedly hath&mdash;to depart from the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He has found by experience that the friendship of the pope is
not vital to England.</div>

<p>"For we, ye may say, having the justness of our cause for us, with such an
entire and whole consent of our nobility and commons of our realm and
subjects, and being all matters passed, and in such terms as they now be,
do not find such lack and want of that the pope might do, with us or
against us, as we would for the obtaining thereof be contented to have a
French king our so perfect a friend, to be not only a mediator but a suitor
therein, and a suitor attendant to have audience upon liking and after the
advice of such cardinals as repute it among pastymes to play and dally with
kings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and princes; whose honour, ye may say, is above all things, and more
dear to us in the person of our good brother, than is any piece of our
cause at the pope's hands. And therefore, if there be none other thing but
our cause, and the other causes whereof we be advertised, our advice,
counsel, special desire also and request is, [that our good brother shall]
break off the interview, unless the pope will make suit to him; and
[unless] our said good brother hath such causes of his own as may
<span class="sidenote">King Henry knows the pope and himself also.</span>
particularly tend to his own benefit, honour and profit&mdash;wherein he shall
do great and singular pleasure unto us; <i>giving to understand to the pope,
that we know ourselves and him both and look to be esteemed accordingly</i>."</p>

<p>Should it appear that on receipt of this communication, Francis was still
resolved to persevere, and that he had other objects in view to which Henry
had not been made privy, the ambassadors were then to remind him of the
remaining obligations into which he had entered; and to ascertain to what
degree his assistance might be calculated upon, should the pope pronounce
Henry deposed, and the emperor attempt to enforce the sentence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intended appeal to a general council.</div>

<p>After forwarding these instructions, the king's next step was to anticipate
the pope by an appeal which would neutralize his judgment should he venture
upon it; and which offered a fresh opportunity of restoring the peace of
Christendom, if there was true anxiety to preserve that peace. The hinge of
the great question, in the form which at last it assumed, was the validity
or invalidity of the dispensation by which Henry had married his brother's
widow. Being a matter which touched the limit of the pope's power, the pope
was himself unable to determine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
it in his own favour; and the only
<span class="sidenote">The advantages of this measure.</span>
authority by which the law could be ruled, was a general council. In the
preceding winter, the pope had volunteered to submit the question to this
tribunal; but Henry believing that it was on the point of immediate
solution in another way, had then declined, on the ground that it would
cause a needless delay. He was already married, and he had hoped that
sentence might be given in his favour in time to anticipate the publication
of the ceremony. But he was perfectly satisfied that justice was on his
side; and was equally confident of obtaining the verdict of Europe, if it
could be fairly pronounced. Now, therefore, under the altered
circumstances, he accepted the offered alternative. He anticipated with
tolerable certainty the effect which would be produced at Rome, when the
<span class="sidenote">June 29.</span>
news should arrive there of the Dunstable divorce; and on the 29th of June
he appealed formally, in the presence of the Archbishop of York, from the
pope's impending sentence, to the next general
council.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of the appeal. The king has no intention of derogating
from the lawful privileges of the See of Rome.</div>

<p>Of this curious document the substance was as follows:&mdash;It commenced with a
declaration that the king had no intention of acting otherwise than became
a good Catholic prince; or of injuring the church or attacking the
privileges conceded by God to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Holy See. If his words could be lawfully
shown to have such a tendency, he would revoke, emend, and correct them in
a Catholic spirit.</p>

<p>The general features of the case were then recapitulated. His marriage with
his brother's wife had been pronounced illegal by the principal
<span class="sidenote">But Europe having declared in his favour in his great matter,
"by the inspiration of the Most High," he has married another wife.</span>
universities of Europe, by the clergy of the two provinces of the Church of
England, by the most learned theologians and canonists, and finally, by the
public judgment of the
church.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
He therefore had felt himself free;
and, "by the inspiration of the Most High, had lawfully married another
woman." Furthermore, "for the common weal and tranquillity of the realm of
England, and for the wholesome rule and government of the same, he had
caused to be enacted certain statutes and ordinances, by authority of
parliaments lawfully called for that purpose." "Now, however," he
continued, "we fearing that his Holyness the Pope ... having in our said
<span class="sidenote">He fears that the pope, who has injured him throughout, may now
pass the censures of the church against him.</span>
cause treated us far otherwise than either respect for our dignity and
desert, or the duty of his own office required at his hands, and having
done us many injuries which we now of design do suppress, but which
hereafter we shall be ready, should circumstances so require, to divulge
... may now proceed to acts of further injustice, and heaping wrong on
wrong, may pronounce the censures and other penalties of the spiritual
sword against ourselves, our realm, and subjects, seeking thereby to
deprive us of the use of the sacraments, and to cut us off, in the sight of
the world, from the unity of the church, to the no slight hurt and injury
of our realm and subjects:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"Fearing these things, and desiring to preserve from detriment not only
ourselves, our own dignity and estimation, but also our subjects, committed
to us by Almighty God; to keep them in the unity of the Christian faith,
and in the wonted participation in the sacraments; that, when in truth they
be not cut off from the integrity of the church, nor can nor will be so cut
off in any manner, they may not appear to be so cut off in the estimation
of men; [desiring further] to check and hold back our people whom God has
given to us, lest, in the event of such injury, they refuse utterly to obey
any longer the Roman Pontiff, as a hard and cruel pastor: [for these
causes] and believing, from reasons probable, conjectures likely, and words
used to our injury by his Holiness the Pope, which in divers manners have
been brought to our ears, that some weighty act may be committed by him or

council.</span>
others to the prejudice of ourselves and of our realm;&mdash;We, therefore, in
behalf of all and every of our subjects, and of all persons adhering to us
in this our cause, do make our appeal to the next general council, which
shall be lawfully held, in place convenient, with the consent of the
Christian princes, and of such others as it may concern&mdash;not in contempt of
the Holy See, but for defence of the truth of the Gospel, and for the other
causes afore rehearsed. And we do trust in God that it shall not be
interpreted as a thing ill done on our part, if preferring the salvation of
our soul and the relief of our conscience to any mundane respects or
favours, we have in this cause regarded more the Divine law than the laws
of man, and have thought it rather meet to obey God than to obey man."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>By the appeal and the causes which were assigned for it, Henry preoccupied
the ground of the conflict; he entrenched himself in the "debatable land"
of legal uncertainty; and until his position had been pronounced untenable
by the general voice of Christendom, any sentence which the pope could
issue would have but a doubtful validity. It was, perhaps, but a slight
advantage; and the niceties of technical fencing might soon resolve
themselves into a question of mere strength; yet, in the opening of great
conflicts, it is well, even when a resort to force is inevitable, to throw
on the opposing party the responsibility of violence; and Henry had been
led, either by a refinement of policy, or by the plain straightforwardness
of his intentions, into a situation where he could expect without alarm the
unrolling of the future.</p>

<p>The character of that future was likely soon to be decided. The appeal was
published on the 29th of June; and as the pope must have heard, by the
middle of the month at latest, of the trial and judgment at Dunstable, a
few days would bring an account of the manner in which he had received the
intelligence. Prior to the arrival of the couriers, Bennet, with the
assistance of Cardinal Tournon, had somewhat soothed down his exasperation.
Francis, also, having heard that immediate process was threatened, had
written earnestly to deprecate such a
measure;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
and though he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
took the interference "very
displeasantly,"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
the pope could not afford to lose,
by premature impatience, the fruit of all his labour and diplomacy, and had
yielded so far as to promise that nothing of moment should be done. To this
<span class="sidenote">The news of the divorce pronounced at Dunstable arrives at
Rome.</span>
state of mind he had been brought one day in the second week of June. The
morning after, Bennet found him "sore altered." The news of "my Lord of
Canterbury's proceedings" had arrived the preceding night; and "his
Holiness said that [such] doings were too sore for him to stand still at
and do
nothing."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
It was "against his duty towards God and the world to
tolerate them." The imperialist cardinals, impatient before, clamoured that
the evil had been caused by the dilatory timidity with which the case had
been handled from the
first.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
The consistory sate day after day with
<span class="sidenote">General indignation in the consistory.</span>
closed doors;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
and even such members of it had before inclined to the
English side, joined in the common indignation. "Some extreme process" was
instantly looked for, and the English agents, in their daily interviews
with the pope, were forced to listen to language which it was hard to bear
with equanimity. Bennet's well-bred courtesy carried him successfully
through the difficulty; his companion Bonner was not so fortunate. Bonner's
tongue was insolent, and under bad control. He replied to menace by
<span class="sidenote">Bonner is impertinent. The pope threatens to boil him in lead.
He writes in terror to England.</span>
impertinence; and on one occasion was so exasperating, that Clement
threatened to burn him alive, or boil him in a caldron of
lead.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> When
fairly roused, the old man was dangerous; and the future
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Bishop of London
wrote to England in extremity of alarm. His letter has not been found, but
the character of it may be perceived from the reassuring reply of the king.
The agents, Henry said, were not to allow themselves to be frightened; they
<span class="sidenote">Henry comforts him.</span>
were to go on calmly, with their accustomed diligence and dexterity,
disputing the ground from point to point, and trust to him. Their cause was
good, and, with God's help, he would be able to defend them from the malice
of their adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The consistory cools into prudence.</div>

<p>Fortunately for Bonner, the pope's passion was of brief duration, and the
experiment whether Henry's arm could reach to the dungeons of the Vatican
remained untried. The more moderate of the cardinals, also, something
assuaged the storm; and angry as they all were, the majority still saw the
necessity of prudence. In the heat of the irritation, final sentence was to
have been pronounced upon the entire cause, backed by interdict,
excommunication, and the full volume of the papal thunders. At the close of
a month's deliberation they resolved to reserve judgment on the original
question, and to confine themselves for the present to revenging the insult
to the pope by "my Lord of Canterbury." Both the king and the archbishop
had disobeyed a formal inhibition. On the 12th of July, the pope issued a
brief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">July 12. The pope declares the divorce illegal, and commands
Henry to cancel the process. If he fails to obey, he is declared
excommunicated.</span>
declaring Cranmer's judgment to have been illegal, the English
process to have been null and void, and the king, by his disobedience, to
have incurred, <i>ipso facto</i>, the threatened penalties of excommunication.
Of his clemency he suspended these censures till the close of the following
September, in order that time might be allowed to restore the respective
parties to their old positions: if within that period the parties were not
so restored, the censures would fall.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This brief was sent into
Flanders, and fixed in the usual place against the door of a church in
Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Henry was prepared for a measure which was no more than natural. He had
been prepared for it as a possibility when he married. Both he and Francis
must have been prepared for it on their meeting at Calais, when the French
king advised him to marry, and promised to support him through the
consequences. His own measures had been arranged beforehand, and he had
secured himself in technical entrenchments by his appeal. After the issue
of the brief, however, he could allow no English embassy to compliment
Clement by its presence on his visit to France. He "knew the pope," as he
said. Long experience had shown him that nothing was to be gained by
yielding in minor points; and the only chance which now remained of
preserving the established order of Christendom, was to terrify the Vatican
court into submission by the firmness of his attitude. For the present
complications, the court of Rome, not he, was responsible. The pope, with a
culpable complacency for the emperor, had shrunk from discharging a duty
which his office imposed upon him; and the result had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that the duty
was discharged by another. Henry could not blame himself for the
<span class="sidenote">Henry again urges Francis to decline to meet the pope.</span>
consequences of Clement's delinquency. He rather felt himself wronged in
having been driven to so extreme a measure against his will. He resolved,
therefore, to recal the embassy, and once more, though with no great hope
that he would be successful, to invite Francis to fulfil his promise, and
to unite with himself in expressing his resentment at the pope's conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August 8.</div>

<p>His despatch to the Duke of Norfolk on this occasion was the natural sequel
of what he had written a few weeks previously. That letter had failed
wholly of its effect. The interview was resolved upon for quite other
reasons than those which were acknowledged, and therefore was not to be
given up. A promise, however, had been extracted, that it should be given
up, if in the course of the summer the pope "innovated anything" against
the King of England; and Henry now required, formally, that this engagement
should be observed. "A notorious and notable innovation" had been made, and
Francis must either deny his words, or adhere to them. It would be evident
to all the world, if the interview took place under the present
circumstances, that the alliance with England was no longer of the
importance with him which it had been; that his place in the struggle, when
the struggle came, would be found on the papal side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause at issue is the independence of princes.</div>

<p>The language of Henry throughout this paper was very fine and noble. He
reminded Francis that substantially the cause at issue was the cause of all
princes; the pope claiming a right to summon them to plead in the courts of
Rome, and refusing to admit their exemption as sovereign rulers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
He had been required not only to undo his marriage, and cancel the sentence of
<span class="sidenote">He has been required to repeal the Act of Appeals,</span>
divorce, but, as a condition of reconciliation with the Holy See, to undo
also the Act of Appeals, and to restore the papal jurisdiction. He desired
it to be understood, with emphasis, that these points were all equally
sacred, and the repeal of the act was as little to be thought of as the
annulling the marriage. "The pope," he said, "did inforce us to excogitate
<span class="sidenote">Which is impossible.</span>
some new thing, whereby we might be healed and relieved of that continual
disease, to care for our cause at Rome, where such defence was taken from
us, as by the laws of God, nature, and man, is due unto us. Hereupon
depended the wealth of our realm; hereupon consisted the surety of our
succession, which by no other means could be well assured." "And
<span class="sidenote">He, therefore, and the pope are as far asunder as yea
and nay,</span>
therefore," he went on, "you [the Duke] shall say to our good brother, that
the pope persisting in the ways he hath entered, ye must needs despair in
any meeting between the French king and the pope, to produce any such
effect as to cause us to meet in concord with the pope; but we shall be
even as far asunder as is between yea and nay. For to the pope's enterprise
to revoke or put back anything that is done here, either in marriage,
statute, sentence, or proclamation<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;of which four members is knit and
conjoined the surety of our matter, nor any can be removed from the other,
lest thereby the whole edifice should be destroyed&mdash;we will and shall, by
all ways and means say nay, and declare our nay in such sort as the world
shall hear, and the pope feel it. Wherein ye may say our firm trust,
perfect hope, and assured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
confidence is, that our good brother will agree
<span class="sidenote">And he trusts that Francis will agree with him as to the pope's
conduct.</span>
with us: as well for that it should be partly dishonourable for him to see
decay the thing that was of his own foundation and planting; as also that
it should be too much dishonourable for us&mdash;having travelled so far in this
matter, and brought it to this point, that all the storms of the year
passed, it is now come to harvest, trusting to see shortly the fruit of our
marriage, to the wealth, joy, and comfort of all our realm, and our own
singular consolation&mdash;that anything should now be done by us to impair the
same, and to put our issue either in peril of bastardy, or otherwise
disturb that [which] is by the whole agreement of our realm established for
their and our commodity, wealth, and benefit. And in this determination ye
know us to be so fixed, and the contrary hereof to be so infeasible, either
at our hands, or by the consent of the realm, that ye must needs despair of
any order to be taken by the French king with the pope. For if any were by
<span class="sidenote">For himself, he is satisfied that he can retract nothing which
he has justly done,</span>
him taken wherein any of these four pieces should be touched&mdash;that is to
say, the marriage of the queen our wife, the revocation of the Bishop of
Canterbury's sentence, the statute of our realm, or our late proclamation,
which be as it were one&mdash;and as walls, covering, and foundation make a
house, so they knit together, establish, and make one matter&mdash;ye be well
assured, and be so ascertained from us, that in no wise we will relent, but
will, as we have before written, withstand the same. Whereof ye may say
that ye have thought good to advertise him, to the intent he make no
farther promise to the pope therein than may be performed."</p>

<p>The ambassadors were the more emphatically to insist on the king's
resolution, lest Francis, in his desire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
for conciliation, might hold out
hopes to the pope which could not be realized. They were to say, however,
that the King of England still trusted that the interview would not take
place. The see of Rome was asserting a jurisdiction which, if conceded,
would encourage an unlimited usurpation. If princes might be cited to the
papal courts in a cause of matrimony, they might be cited equally in other
causes at the pope's pleasure; and the free kingdoms of Europe would be
converted into dependent provinces of the see of Rome. It concerned alike
the interest and the honour of all sovereigns to resist encroachments which
<span class="sidenote">And the pope must be made to understand his folly.</span>
pointed to such an issue; and, therefore, Henry said he hoped that his good
brother would use the pope as he had deserved, "doing him to understand his
folly, and [that] unless he had first made amends, he could not find in his
heart to have further amity with him."</p>

<p>If notwithstanding, the instructions concluded, "all these persuasions
cannot have place to let the said meeting, and the French king shall say it
is expedient for him to have in his hands the
duchess,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
under pretence
of marriage for his son, which he cannot obtain but by this means, ye shall
say that ye remember ye heard him say once he would never conclude that
marriage but to do us good, which is now infaisible; and now in the voice
of the world shall do us both more hurt in the diminution of the reputation
<span class="sidenote">If the meeting is to go on, and the ambassadors cannot induce
Francis to "break" it, they are to return home.</span>
of our amity than it should do otherwise profit. Nevertheless, [if] ye
cannot let his precise determination, [ye] can but lament and bewail your
own chance to depart home in this sort; and that yet of the two
inconvenients, it is to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> more tolerable to return to us nothing done,
than to be present at the interview and to be compelled to look patiently
upon your master's enemy."</p>

<p>After having entered thus their protest against the French king's conduct,
the embassy was to return to England, leaving a parting intimation of the
single condition under which Henry would consent to treat. If the pope
would declare that "the matrimony with the Lady Catherine was and is
nought, he should do somewhat not to be refused;" except with this
preliminary, no offer whatever could be entertained.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The remonstrance fails.</div>

<p>This communication, as Henry anticipated, was not more effectual than the
former in respect of its immediate object. At the meeting of Calais the
interests of Francis had united him with England, and in pursuing the
objects of Henry he was then pursuing his own. The pope and the emperor had
dissolved the coalition by concessions on the least dangerous side. The
interests of Francis lay now in the other direction, and there are few
instances in history in which governments have adhered to obligations
against their advantage from a spirit of honour, when the purposes with
which they contracted those obligations have been otherwise obtained. The
English embassy returned as they were ordered; the French court pursued
their way to Marseilles; not quarrelling with England; intending to abide
<span class="sidenote">The effect upon the world's opinion.</span>
by the alliance, and to give all proofs of amity which did not involve
inconvenient sacrifices; but producing on the world at large by their
conduct the precise effect which Henry had foretold. The world at large,
looking at acts rather than to words, regarded the interview as a
contrivance to reconcile Francis and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Intended Catholic triumvirate&mdash;the Pope, the Emperor, and the
King of France.</span>
emperor through the intervention
of the pope, as a preliminary for a packed council, and for a holy war
against the Lutherans,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>&mdash;a combination of ominous augury to
Christendom, from the consequences or which, if Germany was to be the first
sufferer, England would be inevitably the second.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the French alliance threatened to fail, the English
government found themselves driven at last to look for a connexion among
those powers from whom they had hitherto most anxiously disconnected
<span class="sidenote">September 6. Henry, against his will, looks towards
Germany.</span>
themselves. At such a time Protestant Germany, not Catholic France, was
England's natural friend. The Reformation was essentially a Teutonic
movement; the Germans, English, the Scotch, the Swedes, the Hollanders, all
were struggling on their various roads towards an end essentially the same.
The same dangers threatened them, the same inspiration moved them; and in
the eyes of the orthodox Catholics they were united in a black communion of
heresy. Unhappily, though this identity was obvious to their enemies, it
<span class="sidenote">Unfortunate want of union among Protestants.</span>
was far from obvious to themselves. The odium theologicum is ever hotter
between sections of the same party which are divided by trifling
differences, than between the open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
representatives of antagonist
principles; and Anglicans and Lutherans, instead of joining hands across
the Channel, endeavoured only to secure each a recognition of themselves at
the expense of the other. The English plumed themselves on their orthodoxy.
They were "not as those publicans," heretics, despisers of the keys
disobedient to authority; they desired only the independence of their
national church, and they proved their zeal for the established faith with
all the warmth of persecution. To the Germans national freedom was of
wholly minor moment, in comparison with the freedom of the soul; the
orthodoxy of England was as distasteful to the disciples of Luther as the
orthodoxy of Rome&mdash;and the interests of Europe were sacrificed on both
sides to this foolish and fatal disunion. Circumstances indeed would not
permit the division to remain in its first intensity, and their common
danger compelled the two nations into a partial understanding. Yet the
reconciliation, imperfect to the last, was at the outset all but
impossible. Their relations were already embittered by many reciprocal acts
of hostility. Henry VIII. had won his spurs as a theologian by an attack on
Luther. Luther had replied by a hailstorm of invectives. The Lutheran books
had been proscribed, the Lutherans themselves had been burnt by Henry's
bishops. The Protestant divines in Germany had attempted to conciliate the
emperor by supporting the cause of Catherine; and Luther himself had spoken
loudly in condemnation of the king. The elements of disunion were so many
and so powerful, that there was little hope of contending against them
successfully. Nevertheless, as Henry saw, the coalition of Francis and the
emperor, if the pope succeeded in cementing it, was a most serious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
danger,
to which an opposite alliance would alone be an adequate counterpoise; and
the experiment might at least be tried whether such an alliance was
<span class="sidenote">Mission of Stephen Vaughan to the Court of the Elector
of Saxe,</span>
possible. At the beginning of August, therefore, Stephen Vaughan was sent
on a tentative mission to the Elector of Saxe, John Frederick, at
Weimar.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
He was the bearer of letters containing a proposal for a
resident English ambassador; and if the elector gave his consent, he was to
proceed with similar offers to the courts of the Landgrave of Hesse and the
Duke of Lunenberg.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
Vaughan arrived in due time at the elector's court,
was admitted to audience, and delivered his letters. The prince read them,
<span class="sidenote">Which is not welcome.</span>
and in the evening of the same day returned for answer a polite but wholly
absolute refusal. Being but a prince elector, he said, he might not aspire
to so high an honour as to be favoured with the presence of an English
ambassador. It was not the custom in Germany, and he feared that if he
consented he should displease the emperor.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
The meaning of such a reply
delivered in a few hours was not to be mistaken, however disguised in
courteous language. The English emissary saw that he was an unwelcome
visitor, and that he must depart with the utmost celerity. "The elector,"
<span class="sidenote">The Elector had no anxiety to compromise himself with the
Emperor.</span>
he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
"thirsted to have me gone from him, which I right well
perceived by evident tokens which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
declared unto me the same." He had no
anxiety to expose to hazard the toleration which the Protestant dukedoms as
yet enjoyed from the emperor, by committing himself to a connexion with a
prince with whose present policy he had no sympathy, and whose conversion
to the cause of the Reformation he had as yet no reason to believe
sincere.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The reception which Vaughan met with at Weimar satisfied him that he need
go no further; neither the Landgrave nor the Duke of Lunenberg would be
likely to venture on a course which the elector so obviously feared. He,
therefore, gave up his mission, and returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The failure a not unprofitable lesson to England.</div>

<p>The first overtures in this direction issued in complete failure, nor was
the result wholly to be regretted. It taught Henry (or it was a first
commencement of the lesson) that so long as he pursued a merely English
policy he might not expect that other nations would embroil themselves in
his defence. He must allow the Reformation a wider scope, he must permit it
to comprehend within its possible consequences the breaking of the chains
by which his subjects' minds were bound&mdash;not merely a change of jailors.
Then perhaps the German princes might return some other answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
The disappointment, however, fell lightly; for before the account of the
failure had reached England, an event had happened, which, poor as the king
might be in foreign alliances, had added most material strength to his
position in England. The full moment of that event he had no means of
<span class="sidenote">September 7. Birth of the Princess Elizabeth.</span>
knowing. In its immediate bearing it was matter for most abundant
satisfaction. On the seventh of September, between three and four in the
afternoon, at the palace of Greenwich, was born a princess, named three
days later in her baptism, after the king's mother, Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A son
had been hoped for. The child was a daughter only; yet at least Providence
had not pronounced against the marriage by a sentence of barrenness; at
least there was now an heir whose legitimacy the nation had agreed to
<span class="sidenote">Exultation in London.</span>
accept. Te Deums were sung in all the churches; again the river decked
itself in splendour; again all London steeples were musical with bells. A
font of gold was presented for the christening. Francis, in compensation
for his backslidings, had consented to be godfather; and the infant, who
was soon to find her country so rude a stepmother, was received with all
<span class="sidenote">Light and shadow.</span>
the outward signs of exulting welcome. To Catherine's friends the offspring
of the rival marriage was not welcome, but was an object rather of bitter
hatred; and the black cloud of a sister's jealousy gathered over the cradle
whose innocent occupant had robbed her of her title and her expectations.
To the king, to the parliament, to the healthy heart of England, she was an
object of eager hope and an occasion for thankful gratitude; but the seeds
were sown with her birth of those misfortunes which were soon to overshadow
her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> and to form the school of the great nature which in its maturity
would re-mould the world.</p>

<p>Leaving Elizabeth for the present, we return to the continent, and to the
long-promised interview, which was now at last approaching. Henry made no
further attempt to remonstrate with Francis; and Francis assured him, and
with all sincerity, that he would use his best efforts to move the pope to
make the necessary concessions. The English embassy meanwhile was
withdrawn. The excommunication had been received as an act of hostility, of
which Henry would not even condescend to complain; and it was to be
understood distinctly that in any exertions which might be made by the
<span class="sidenote">Preparations for the interview at Marseilles.</span>
French king, the latter was acting without commission on his own
responsibility. The intercession was to be the spontaneous act of a mutual
friend, who, for the interests of Christendom, desired to heal a dangerous
wound; but neither directly nor indirectly was it to be interpreted as an
expression of a desire for a reconciliation on the English side.</p>

<p>It was determined further, on the recal of the Duke of Norfolk, that the
opportunity of the meeting should be taken to give a notice to the pope of
the king's appeal to the council; and for this purpose, Bennet and Bonner
were directed to follow the papal court from Rome. Bennet never
accomplished this journey, dying on the route, worn out with much
service.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
His death delayed Bonner, and the conferences had opened for
many days before his arrival. Clement had reached Marseilles by ship from
Genoa, about the 20th of October. As if pointedly to irritate Henry, he had
<span class="sidenote">The pope arrives under the conduct of the Duke of Albany.</span>
placed himself under the conduct of the Duke of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Albany.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
He was followed two days later by his fair niece, Catherine de Medici; and the
preparations for the marriage were commenced with the utmost swiftness and
secrecy. The conditions of the contract were not allowed to transpire, but
they were concluded in three days; and on the 25th of October the pope
<span class="sidenote">Oct. 25th. Marriage of Henry Duke of Orleans, and Catherine de
Medici.</span>
bestowed his precious present on the Duke of Orleans, he himself performing
the nuptial ceremony, and accompanying it with his paternal benediction on
the young pair, and on the happy country which was to possess them for its
king and queen. France being thus securely riveted to Rome, other matters
could be talked of more easily. Francis made all decent overtures to the
pope in behalf of Henry; if the pope was to be believed indeed, he was
vehemently urgent.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Clement in turn made suggestions for terms of
alliance between Francis and Charles, "to the advantage of the Most
Christian king;"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
and thus parried the remonstrances. The only point
<span class="sidenote">Amicable differences between the pope and Francis on the English
question.</span>
positively clear to the observers, was the perfect understanding which
existed between the King of France and his spiritual
father.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
Unusual activity was remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in the dockyards; Italian soldiers of fortune were
about the court in unusual numbers, and apparently in
favour.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> An
invasion of Lombardy was talked of among the palace retinue; and the
emperor was said to distrust the intentions of the conference. Possibly
<span class="sidenote">General distrust.</span>
experience had taught all parties to doubt each other's faith. Possibly
they were all in some degree waiting upon events; and had not yet resolved
upon their conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bonner at Marseilles.</div>

<p>In the midst of this scene arrived Doctor Bonner, in the beginning of
November, with Henry's appeal. He was a strange figure to appear in such a
society. There was little probity, perhaps, either in the court of France,
or in their Italian visitors: but of refinement, of culture, of those
graces which enable men to dispense with the more austere excellences of
character,&mdash;which transform licentiousness into elegant frailty, and
treachery and falsehood into pardonable finesse,&mdash;of these there was very
much: and when a rough, coarse, vulgar Englishman was plunged among these
delicate ladies and gentlemen, he formed an element which contrasted
strongly with the general environment. Yet Bonner, perhaps, was not without
<span class="sidenote">Character of Bonner.</span>
qualifications which fitted him for his mission. He was not, indeed,
virtuous; but he had a certain downright honesty about him, joined with an
entire insensibility to those finer perceptions which would have interfered
with plain speaking, where plain speaking was desirable; he had a broad,
not ungenial humour, which showed him things and persons in their genuine
light, and enabled him to picture them for us with a distinctness for which
we owe him lasting thanks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">November 7.</div>

<p>He appeared at Marseilles on the 7th of November, and had much difficulty
in procuring an interview. At length, weary of waiting, and regardless of
the hot lead with which he had been lately threatened, he forced his way
into the room where "the pope was standing, with the Cardinals De Lorraine
and Medici, ready apparelled with his stole to go to the consistory."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bonner's letter to the king.</div>

<p>"Incontinently upon my coming thither," he wrote to Henry,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "the pope,
whose sight is incredulous quick, eyed me, and that divers times; making a
good pause in one place; at which time I desired the datary to advertise
his Holiness that I would speak with him; and albeit the datary made no
little difficulty therein, yet perceiving that upon refusal I would have
gone forthwith to the pope, he advertised the pope of my said desire. His
Holiness dismissing as then the said cardinals, and letting his vesture
fall, went to a window in the said chamber, calling me unto him. At which
time I showed unto his Holiness how that your Highness had given me express
and strait commandment to intimate unto him how that your Grace had
solemnly provoked and appealed unto the general council; submitting
yourself to the tuition and defence thereof; which provocation and appeal I
had under authentic writings then with me, to show for that purpose. And
herewithal I drew out the said writing, showing his said Holiness that I
brought the same in proof of the premises, and that his Holiness might see
and perceive all the same. The pope having this for a breakfast, only
pulled down his head to his shoulders, after the Italian fashion, and said
that because he was as then fully ready to go into the consistory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> he
would not tarry to hear or see the said writings, but willed me to come at
afternoon."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's appeal is delivered to the pope.</div>

<p>The afternoon came, and Bonner returned, and was admitted. There was some
conversation upon indifferent matters; the pope making good-natured
inquiries about Bennet, and speaking warmly and kindly of him.</p>

<p>"Presently," Bonner continues, "falling out of that, he said that he
marvelled your Highness would use his Holiness after such sort as it
appears ye did. I said that your Highness no less did marvel that his
Holiness having found so much benevolence and kindness at your hands in all
times past, would for acquittal show such unkindness as of late he did. And
here we entered in communication upon two points: one was that his
Holiness, having committed in times past, and in most ample form, the cause
into the realm, promising not to revoke the said commission, and over that,
to confirm the process and sentence of the commissaries, should not at the
point of sentence have advoked the cause, retaining it at Rome&mdash;forasmuch
as Rome was a place whither your Highness could not, ne yet ought,
personally to come unto, and also was not bound to send thither your
proctor. The second point was, that your Highness's cause being, in the
opinion of the best learned men in Christendom, approved good and just, and
so [in] many ways known unto his Holiness, the same should not so long have
retained it in his hands without judgment.</p>

<p>"His Holiness answering the same, as touching the first point, said that if
the queen (meaning the late wife of Prince Arthur, calling her always in
his conversation the queen) had not given an oath refusing the judges as
suspect, he would not have advoked the mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>ter at all, but been content
that it should have been determined and ended in your realm. But seeing she
gave that oath, appealing also to his court, he might and ought to hear
her, his promise made to your Highness, which was qualified,
notwithstanding. As touching the second point, his Holiness said that your
Highness only was the default thereof, because ye would not send a proxy to
the cause. These matters, however, he said, had been many times fully
talked upon at Rome; and therefore [he] willed me to omit further
communication thereupon, and to proceed to the doing of such things that I
was specially sent for.</p>

<p>"Whereupon making protestation of your Highness's mind and intent towards
the see apostolic&mdash;not intending anything to do in contempt of the same&mdash;I
exhibited unto his Holiness the commission which your Highness had sent
unto me; and his Holiness delivering it to the datary, commanded him to
read it; and hearing in the same the words (referring to the injuries which
he had done to your Highness), he began to look up after a new sort, and
said, 'O questo et multo vero! (this is much true!)' meaning that it was
not true indeed. And verily, sure not only in this, but also in many parts
of the said commission, he showed himself grievously offended; insomuch
that, when those words, 'To the next general council which shall be
<span class="sidenote">The pope's anger.</span>
lawfully held in place convenient,' were read, he fell in a marvellous
great choler and rage, not only declaring the same by his gesture and
manner, but also by words: speaking with great vehemence, and saying, 'Why
did not the king, when I wrote to my nuncio this year past, to speak unto
him for this general council, give no answer unto my said nuncio, but
referred him for answer to the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> king? at what time he might perceive
by my doing, that I was very well disposed, and much spake for it.' 'The
thing so standing, now to speak of a general council! Oh, good Lord! but
well! his commission and all his other writings cannot be but welcome unto
me;' which words methought he spake willing to hide his choler, and make me
believe that he was nothing angry with their doings, when in very deed I
perceived, by many arguments, that it was otherwise. And one among others
was taken here for infallible with them that knoweth the pope's conditions,
that he was continually folding up and unwinding of his handkerchief, which
he never doth but when he is tickled to the very heart with great choler."</p>

<p>At length the appeal was read through; and at the close of it Francis
entered, and talked to the pope for some time, but in so low a voice that
Bonner could not hear what was passing. When he had gone, his Holiness said
that he would deliberate upon the appeal with the consistory, and after
hearing their judgments would return his answer.</p>

<p>Three days passed, and then the English agent was informed that he might
again present himself. The pope had recovered his calmness. When he had
time to collect himself, Clement could speak well and with dignity; and if
we could forget that his conduct was substantially unjust, and that in his
conscience he knew it to be unjust, he would almost persuade us to believe
him honest. "He said," wrote Bonner, "that his mind towards your Highness
always had been to minister justice, and to do pleasure to you; albeit it
hath not been so taken: and he never unjustly grieved your Grace that he
knoweth, nor intendeth hereafter to do. As concerning the appeal, he said
that, forasmuch as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
there was a constitution of Pope Pius, his predecessor,
<span class="sidenote">The appeal is rejected.</span>
that did condemn and reprove all such appeals, he did therefore reject your
Grace's appeal as frivolous, forbidden, and unlawful." As touching the
council, he said generally, that he would do his best that it should meet;
but it was to be understood that the calling a general council belonged to
him, and not to the King of England.</p>

<p>The audience ended, and Bonner left the pope convinced that he intended, on
his return to Rome, to execute the censures and continue the process
without delay. That the sentence which he would pronounce would be against
the king appeared equally certain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yet on Bonner's departure Clement assures Francis that the King
of England's cause is just,</div>

<p>It appeared certain, yet after all no certain conclusion is possible.
Francis I., though not choosing to quarrel with the see of Rome to do a
pleasure to Henry, was anxious to please his ally to the extent of his
convenience; at any rate, he would not have gratuitously deceived him; and
still less would he have been party to an act of deliberate treachery. When
Bonner was gone he had a last interview with the pope, in which he urged
upon him the necessity of complying with Henry's demands; and the pope on
this occasion said that he was satisfied that the King of England was
<span class="sidenote">And if he will only acknowledge the Papal authority, he will
give sentence in his favour.</span>
right; that his cause was good; and that he had only to acknowledge the
papal jurisdiction by some formal act, to find sentence immediately
pronounced in his favour. Except for his precipitation, and his refusal to
depute a proxy to plead for him, his wishes would have been complied with
long before. In the existing posture of affairs, and after the measures
which had been passed in England with respect to the see of Rome, he
himself, the pope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> said, could not make advances without some kind of
submission; but a single act of acknowledgment was all which he
required.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the pope honest? or treacherous? or merely weak.</div>

<p>Extraordinary as it must seem, the pope certainly bound himself by this
engagement: and who can tell with what intention? To believe him sincere
and to believe him false seems equally impossible. If he was persuaded that
Henry's cause <i>was</i> good, why did he in the following year pronounce
finally for Catherine? why had he imperilled so needlessly the interests of
the papacy in England? why had his conduct from the beginning pointed
steadily to the conclusion at which he at last arrived? and why throughout
<span class="sidenote">Let us try to judge him charitably.</span>
Europe were the ultramontane party, to a man, on Catherine's side? On the
other hand, what object at such a time can be conceived for falsehood? Can
we suppose that he designed to dupe Henry into submission by a promise
which he had predetermined to break? It is hard to suppose even Clement
capable of so elaborate an act of perfidy; and it is, perhaps, idle to
waste conjectures on the motives of a weak, much-agitated man. He was,
probably, but giving a fresh example of his disposition to say at each
moment whatever would be most agreeable to his hearers. This was his
unhappy habit, by which he earned for himself a character for dishonesty, I
labour to think, but half deserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposal that the cause should be referred to a commission, to
sit at Cambray.</div>

<p>If, however, Clement meant to deceive, he succeeded, undoubtedly, in
deceiving the French king, Francis, in communicating to Henry the language
which the pope had used, entreated him to reconsider his resolution. The
objection to pleading at Rome might be overcome; for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> the pope would meet
him in a middle course. Judges could be appointed, who should sit at
Cambray, and pass a sentence in condemnation of the original marriage; with
a definite promise that their sentence should not again be called in
question. To this arrangement there could be no reasonable objection; and
Francis implored that a proposal so liberal should not be rejected.
Sufficient danger already threatened Christendom, from heretics within and
from the Turks without; and although the English parliament were agreed to
maintain the second marriage, it was unwise to provoke the displeasure of
foreign princes. To allow time for the preliminary arrangements, the
execution of the censures had been further postponed; and if Henry would
make up the quarrel, the French monarch was commissioned to offer a league,
offensive and defensive, between England, France, and the Papacy. He
<span class="sidenote">Francis implores Henry to consent.</span>
himself only desired to be faithful to his engagements to his good brother;
and as a proof of his good faith, he said that he had been offered the
Duchy of Milan, if he would look on while the emperor and the pope attacked
England.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This language bears all the character of sincerity, and when we remember
that it followed immediately upon a close and intimate communication of
three weeks with Clement, it is not easy to believe that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> could have
mistaken the extent of the pope's promises. We may suppose Clement for the
moment to have been honest, or wavering between honesty and falsehood; we
may suppose further that Francis trusted him because it was undesirable to
be suspicious, in the belief that he was discharging the duty of a friend
to Henry and of a friend to the church, in offering to mediate upon these
terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspicions of Henry.</div>

<p>But Henry was far advanced beyond the point at which fair words could move
him. He had trusted many times, and had been many times deceived. It was
not easy to entangle him again. It mattered little whether Clement was weak
or false; the result was the same&mdash;he could not be trusted. To an open
<span class="sidenote">His disgust with Clement.</span>
English understanding there was something monstrous in the position of a
person professing to be a judge, who admitted that a cause which lay before
him was so clear that he could bind himself to a sentence upon it, and
could yet refuse to pronounce that sentence, except upon conditions. It was
scarcely for the interests of justice to leave the distribution of it in
hands so questionable.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of coming forward, as Francis hoped, instead of
consenting to entangle himself again in the meshes of diplomatic intrigue,
the king returned a peremptory refusal.</p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk, and such of the council as dreaded the completion of
the schism, assured d'Inteville, the French ambassador, that for themselves
they considered Francis was doing the best for England which could be done,
and that they deprecated violent measures as much as possible; but in all
this party there was a secret leaning to Queen Catherine, a dislike of
Queen Anne and the whole Boleyn race, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> private hope and belief that
the pope would after all be firm. Their tongues were therefore tied. They
durst not speak except alone in whispers to each other, and the French
ambassador, who did dare, only drew from Henry a more determined expression
of his resolution.</p>

<p>As to his measures in England, the king said, the pope had begun the
quarrel by issuing censures and by refusing to admit his reasons for
declining to plead at Rome. He was required to send a proctor, and was told
that the cause should be decided in favour of whichever party was so
represented there. For the sake of all other princes as well as himself, he
would send no proctor, nor would he seem to acquiesce in the pretences of
the papal see. The King of France told him that the pope admitted the
justice of his cause. Let the pope do justice, then. The laws passed in
parliament were for the benefit of the commonwealth, and he would never
revoke them. He demanded no reparation, and could make no reparation. He
asked only for his right, and if he could not obtain it, he had God and
truth on his side, and that was enough. In vain d'Inteville answered
feebly, that his master had done all that was in his power; the king
replied that the French council wished to entangle him with the pope; but
for his own part he would never more acknowledge the pope in his pretended
capacity. He might be bishop of Rome, or pope also, if he preferred the
name; but the see of Rome should have no more jurisdiction in England, and
he thought he would be none the worse Christian on that account, but rather
the better. Jesus Christ he would acknowledge, and him only, as the true
Lord of Christian men, and Christ's word only should be preached in
England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> The Spaniards might invade him as they threatened. He did not
fear them. They might come, but they might not find it so easy to
return.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The King had taken his position and was prepared for the consequences. He
had foreseen for more than a year the possibility of an attempted invasion;
and since his marriage, he had been aware that the chances of success in
the adventure had been discussed on the Continent by the papal and imperial
party. The pope had spoken of his censures being enforced, and Francis had
revealed to Henry the nature of the dangerous overtures which had been made
to himself. The Lutheran princes had hurriedly declined to connect
themselves in any kind of alliance with England: and on the 25th of
September, Stephen Vaughan had reported that troops were being raised in
Germany, which rumour destined for Catherine's service.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Ireland, too,
as we shall hear in the next chapter, was on the verge of an insurrection,
which had been fomented by papal agents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conditions under which invasion might be dangerous.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, there was no real danger from an invasion, unless it was
accompanied with an insurrection at home, or with a simultaneous attack
from Scotland; and while of the first there appeared upon the surface no
probability, with Scotland a truce for a year had been concluded on the 1st
of October.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The king, therefore, had felt himself reasonably secure.
Parliament had seemed unanimous; the clergy
<span class="sidenote">Apparent tranquillity of England.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
were submissive; the nation

approving;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
and as late as the beginning of
November, 1533, no suspicion seems to have been entertained of the spread
of serious disaffection. A great internal revolution had been accomplished;
a conflict of centuries between the civil and spiritual powers had been
terminated without a life lost or a blow struck. Partial murmurs there had
been, but murmurs were inevitable, and, so far as the government yet knew,
were harmless. The Scotch war had threatened to be dangerous, but it had
been extinguished. Impatient monks had denounced the king from the pulpits,
and disloyal language had been reported from other quarters, which had
roused vigilance, but had not created alarm. The Nun of Kent had forced
herself into the royal presence with menacing prophecies; but she had
appeared to be a harmless dreamer, who could only be made of importance by
punishment. The surface of the nation was in profound repose. Cromwell,
like Walsingham after him, may perhaps have known of the fire which was
smouldering below, and have watched it silently till the moment came at
which to trample it out; but no symptom of uneasiness appears either in the
conduct of the government or in the official correspondence. The
organization of the friars, the secret communication of the Nun with
Catherine and the Princess Mary, with the papal nuncio, or with noble
lords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and reverend bishops, was either unknown, or the character of those
<span class="sidenote">The Nun of Kent's conspiracy.</span>
communications was not suspected. That a serious political conspiracy
should have shaped itself round the ravings of a seeming lunatic, to all
appearance had not occurred as a possibility to a single member of the
council, except to those whose silence was ensured by their complicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first occasion of suspicion.</div>

<p>So far as we are able to trace the story (for the links of the chain which
led to the discovery of the designs which were entertained, are something
imperfect), the suspicions of the government were first roused in the
following manner:</p>

<p>Queen Catherine, as we have already seen, had been called upon, at the
coronation of Anne Boleyn, to renounce her title, and she had refused. Mary
had been similarly deprived of her rank as princess; but either her
disgrace was held to be involved in that of her mother, or some other
cause, perhaps the absence of immediate necessity, had postponed the demand
for her own personal submission. As, however, on the publication of the
second marriage, it had been urged on Catherine that there could not be two
<span class="sidenote">On the birth of Elizabeth, the Princess Mary is called upon to
surrender her title.</span>
queens in England, so on the birth of the Princess Elizabeth, an analogous
argument required the disinheritance of Mary. It was a hard thing; but her
mother's conduct obliged the king to be peremptory. She might have been
legitimatized by act of parliament, if Catherine would have submitted. The
consequences of Catherine's refusal might be cruel, but they were
unavoidable.</p>

<p>Mary was not with her mother. It had been held desirable to remove her from
an influence which would encourage her in a useless opposition; and she was
residing at Beaulieu, afterwards New Hall, in Essex,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> under the care of
Lord Hussey and the Countess of Salisbury. Lord Hussey was a dangerous
guardian, he was subsequently executed for his complicity in the Pilgrimage
of Grace, the avowed object of which was the restoration of Mary to her
place as heir-apparent. We may believe, therefore, that while under his
surveillance she experienced no severe restraint, nor received that advice
with respect to her conduct which prudence would have dictated. Lord
Hussey, however, for the present enjoyed the confidence of the king, and
was directed to inform his charge, that for the future she was to consider
herself not as princess, but as the king's natural daughter, the Lady Mary
Tudor. The message was a painful one; painful, we will hope, more on her
mother's account than on her own; but her answer implied that, as yet,
Henry VIII. was no object of especial terror to his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She replies haughtily and violently.</div>

<p>"Her Grace replied," wrote Lord Hussey to the council in communicating the
result of his undertaking,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> that "she could not a little marvel that I
being alone, and not associate with some other the king's most honourable
council, nor yet sufficiently authorized neither by commission nor by any
other writing from the King's Highness, would attempt to declare such a
high enterprise and matter of no little weight and importance unto her
Grace, in diminishing her said estate and name; her Grace not doubting that
she is the king's true and legitimate daughter and heir procreate in good
and lawful matrimony; [and] further adding, that unless she were advertised
from his Highness by his writing that his Grace was so minded to diminish
her estate, name, and dignity, which she trusteth his Highness will never
do, she would not believe it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Inasmuch as Mary was but sixteen at this time, the resolution which she
displayed in sending such a message was considerable. The early English
held almost Roman notions on the nature of parental authority, and the tone
of a child to a father was usually that of the most submissive reverence.
<span class="sidenote">She writes to the king in a similar tone.</span>
Nor was she contented with replying indirectly through her guardian. She
wrote herself to the king, saying that she neither could nor would in her
conscience think the contrary, but that she was his lawful daughter born in
true matrimony, and that she thought that he in his own conscience did
judge the same.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Such an attitude in so young a girl was singular, yet not necessarily
censurable. Henry was not her only parent, and if we suppose her to have
been actuated by affection for her mother, her conduct may appear not
pardonable only, but spirited and creditable. In insisting upon her
legitimacy, nevertheless, she was not only asserting the good name and fame
of Catherine of Arragon, but unhappily her own claim to the succession to
the throne. It was natural that under the circumstances she should have
felt her right to assert that claim; for the injury which she had suffered
was patent not only to herself, but to Europe. Catherine might have been
required to give way that the king might have a son, and that the
succession might be established in a prince; but so long as the child of
the second marriage was a daughter only, it seemed substantially monstrous
to set aside the elder for the younger. Yet the measure was a harsh
necessity; a link in the chain which could not be broken. The harassed
nation insisted above all things that no doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
should hang over the
future, and it was impossible in the existing complications to recognise
the daughter of Catherine without excluding Elizabeth, and excluding the
<span class="sidenote">Danger to the nation of Mary's attitude.</span>
prince who was expected to follow her. By asserting her title, Mary was
making herself the nucleus of sedition, which on her father's death would
lead to a convulsion in the realm. She might not mean it, but the result
would not be affected by a want of purpose in herself; and it was possible
that her resolution might create immediate and far more painful
complications. The king's excommunication was imminent, and if the censures
were enforced by the emperor, she would be thrust into the unpermitted
position of her father's rival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king treats her as a petulant child.</div>

<p>The political consequences of her conduct, notwithstanding, although
evident to statesmen, might well be concealed from a headstrong, passionate
girl. There was no suspicion that she herself was encouraging any of these
dangerous thoughts, and Henry looked upon her answer to Lord Hussey and her
letter to himself as expressions of petulant folly. Lord Oxford, the Earl
of Essex, and the Earl of Sussex were directed to repair to Beaulieu, and
explain to her the situation in which she had placed herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His letter explaining to her the true nature of her position.</div>

<p>"Considering," wrote the king to them, "how highly such contempt and
rebellion done by our daughter and her servants doth touch not only us, and
the surety of our honour and person, but also the tranquillity of our
realm; and not minding to suffer the pernicious example hereof to spread
far abroad, but to put remedy to the same in due time, we have given you
commandment to declare to her the great folly, temerity, and indiscretion
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> she hath used herein, with the peril she hath incurred by reason of
her so doing. By these her ungodly doings hitherto she hath most worthily
deserved our high indignation and displeasure, and thereto no less pain and
punition than by the order of the laws of our realm doth appertain in case
of high treason, unless our mercy and clemency should be shewed in that
behalf. [If, however, after] understanding our mind and pleasure, [she
will] conform herself humbly and obediently to the observation of the same,
according to the office and duty of a natural daughter, and of a true and
faithful subject, she may give us cause hereafter to incline our fatherly
pity to her reconciliation, her benefit and advancement."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The reply of Mary to this message is not discoverable; but it is certain
that she persisted in her resolution, and clung either to her mother's
"cause" or to her own rank and privilege, in sturdy defiance of her father.
To punish her insubordination or to tolerate it was equally difficult; and
the government might have been in serious embarrassment had not a series of
discoveries, following rapidly one upon the other, explained the mystery of
these proceedings, and opened a view with alarming clearness into the
undercurrents of the feeling of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Correspondence between Queen Catherine, the Court of Rome, and
the Emperor.</div>

<p>Information from time to time had reached Henry from Rome, relating to the
correspondence between Catherine and the pope. Perhaps, too, he knew how
assiduously she had importuned the emperor to force Clement to a
decision.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> No effort, however, had been hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> made to interfere
with her hospitalities, or to oblige her visitors to submit to scrutiny
before they could be admitted to her presence. She was the mistress of her
own court and of her own actions; and confidential agents, both from Rome,
Brussels, and Spain, had undoubtedly passed and repassed with reciprocal
instructions and directions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two suspicious friars at Bugden,</div>

<p>The crisis which was clearly approaching had obliged Henry, in the course
of this autumn, to be more watchful; and about the end of October, or the
beginning of November,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> two friars were reported as having been at
Bugden, whose movements attracted suspicion from their anxiety to escape
observation. Secret agents of the government, who had been "set" for the
purpose, followed the friars to London, and notwithstanding "many wiles and
cautells by them invented to escape," the suspected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">"Followed" to London; arrested, and probably tortured.</span>
persons were arrested
and brought before Cromwell. Cromwell "upon examination, could gather
nothing from them of any moment or great importance;" but, "entering on
further communication," he said "he found one of them a very seditious
person, and so committed them to ward." The king was absent from London,
but had left directions that, in the event of any important occurrence of
the kind, Archbishop Cranmer should be sent for; but Cranmer not being
immediately at hand, Cromwell wrote to Henry for instructions; inasmuch as,
he said, "it is undoubted that they (the monks) have intended, and would
confess, some great matter, if they might be examined as they ought to
be&mdash;that is to say, by pains."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conspiracy, in which the Princess Mary was implicated, to
dethrone the King.</div>

<p>The curtain here falls over the two prisoners; we do not know whether they
were tortured, whether they confessed, or what they confessed; but we may
naturally connect this letter, directly or indirectly, with the events
which immediately followed. In the middle of November we find a commission
sitting at Lambeth, composed of Cromwell, Cranmer, and Latimer, ravelling
out the threads of a story, from which, when the whole was disentangled, it
appeared that by Queen Catherine, the Princess Mary, and a large and
formidable party in the country, the king, on the faith of a pretended
revelation, was supposed to have forfeited the crown; that his death,
either by visitation of God or by visitation of man, was daily expected;
and that whether his death took place or not, a revolution was immediately
looked for, which would place the princess on the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prophecies of the Nun of Kent.</div>

<p>The Nun of Kent, as we remember, had declared that if Henry persisted in
his resolution of marrying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Anne, she was commissioned by God to tell him
that he should lose his power and authority. She had not specified the
manner in which the sentence would be carried into effect against him. The
form of her threats had been also varied occasionally; she said that he
should die, but whether by the hands of his subjects, or by a providential
judgment, she left to
conjecture;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and the period within which his
punishment was to fall upon him was stated variously at one month or at
six.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
She had attempted no secresy with these prophecies; she had
<span class="sidenote">December.</span>
confined herself in appearance to words; and the publicity which she
courted having prevented suspicion of secret conspiracy, Henry quietly
accepted the issue, and left the truth of the prophecy to be confuted by
the event. He married. The one month passed; the six months passed:
eight&mdash;nine months. His child was born and was baptized, and no divine
thunder had interposed; only a mere harmless verbal thunder, from a poor
old man at Rome. The illusion, as he imagined, had been lived down, and had
expired of its own vanity.</p>

<p>But the Nun and her friar advisers were counting on other methods of
securing the fulfilment of the prophecy than supernatural assistance. It is
remarkable that, hypocrites and impostors as they knew themselves to be,
they were not without a half belief that some supernatural intervention was
imminent; but the career on which they had entered was too fascinating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> to
<span class="sidenote">The Nun half deceiver, and half herself deceived.</span>
allow them to forsake it when their expectation failed them. They were
swept into the stream which was swelling to resist the Reformation, and
allowed themselves to be hurried forward either to victory or to
destruction.</p>

<p>The first revelation being apparently confuted by facts, a second was
produced as an interpretation of it; which, however, was not published like
the other, but whispered in secret to persons whose dispositions were
known.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">On the failure of the first prophecy, an interpretation is
discovered of a perilous kind. The king is declared to be in the condition
of Saul after his rejection.</div>

<p>"When the King's Grace," says the report of the commissioners, "had
continued in good health, honour, and prosperity more than a month, Dr.
Bocking shewed the said Nun, that as King Saul, abjected from his kingdom
by God, yet continued king in the sight of the world, so her said
revelations might be taken. And therefore the said Nun, upon this
information, forged another revelation, that her words should be
understanded to mean that the King's Grace should not be king in the
reputation or acceptation of God, not one month or one hour after that he
married the Queen's Grace that now is. The first revelation had moved a
great number of the king's subjects, both high and low, to grudge against
the said marriage before it was concluded and perfected; and also induced
such as were stiffly bent against that marriage, daily to look for the
destruction of the King's Grace within a month after he married the Queen's
Grace that now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> is. And when they were deluded in that expectation, the
second revelation was devised not only as an interpretation of the former,
but to the intent to induce the king's subjects to believe that God took
the King's Grace for no king of this realm; and that they should likewise
take him for no righteous king, and themselves not bounden to be his
subjects; which might have put the King and the Queen's Grace in jeopardy
of their crown and of their issue, and the people of this realm in great
danger of destruction."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It was no light matter to pronounce the king to be in the position of Saul
after his rejection; and read by the light of the impending
excommunication, the Nun's words could mean nothing but treason. The
speaker herself was in correspondence with the pope; she had attested her
divine commission by miracles, and had been recognised as a saint by an
<span class="sidenote">The prophecies in extensive secret circulation in a written
form.</span>
Archbishop of Canterbury; the regular orders of the clergy throughout the
realm were known to regard her as inspired; and when the commission
recollected that the king was threatened further with dying "a villain's
death"; and that these and similar prophecies were carefully written out,
and were in private circulation through the country, the matter assumed a
dangerous complexion: it became at once essential to ascertain how far, and

among what classes of the state, these things had penetrated. The Friars
Mendicant were discovered to be in league with her, and these itinerants
were ready-made missionaries of sedition. They had privilege of vagrancy
without check or limit; and owing to their universal distribution and the
freemasonry among themselves, the secret disposition of every family
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> in
England was intimately known to them. No movement, therefore, could be
securely overlooked in which these orders had a share; the country might be
undermined in secret; and the government might only learn their danger at
the moment of explosion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrest of the Nun and five monks.</div>

<p>No sooner, therefore, were the commissioners in possession of the general
facts, than the principal parties&mdash;that is to say, the Nun herself and five
of the monks of Christ Church at Canterbury&mdash;with whom her intercourse was
most constant, were sent to the Tower to be "examined,"&mdash;the monks it is
likely by "torture," if they could not otherwise be brought to confession.
The Nun was certainly not tortured. On her first arrest, she was obstinate
in maintaining her prophetic character; and she was detected in sending
messages to her friends, "to animate them to adhere to her and to her
prophecies."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
<span class="sidenote">She confesses.</span>
But her courage ebbed away under the hard reality of her
position. She soon made a full confession, in which her accomplices joined
her; and the half-completed web of conspiracy was ravelled out. They did
not attempt to conceal that they had intended, if possible, to create an
<span class="sidenote">A list is obtained of the persons who were implicated with her.</span>
insurrection. The five monks&mdash;Father Bocking, Father Rich, Father Rysby,
Father Dering, and Father Goold&mdash;had assisted the Nun in inventing her
"Revelations": and as apostles, they had travelled about the country to
communicate them in whatever quarters they were likely to be welcome. When
we remember that Archbishop Warham had been a dupe of this woman, and that
even Wolsey's experience and ability had not prevented him from believing
in her power, we are not surprised to find high names among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> those who were
implicated. Vast numbers of abbots and priors, and of regular and secular
clergy, had listened eagerly; country gentlemen also, and London merchants.
The Bishop of Rochester had "wept for joy" at the first utterances of the
inspired prophetess; and Sir Thomas More, "who at first did little regard
the said revelations, afterwards did greatly rejoice to hear of them."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
We learn, also, that the Nun had continued to <i>communicate with "the Lady
Princess Dowager" and "the Lady Mary, her daughter</i>."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>These were names which might have furnished cause for regret, but little
for surprise or alarm. The commissioners must have found occasion for other
feelings, however, when among the persons implicated were found the
<span class="sidenote">The Countess of Salisbury and the Marchioness of Exeter.</span>
Countess of Salisbury and the The Marchioness of Exeter, with their
chaplains, households, and servants; Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir George Carew,
and "many of the nobles of
England."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
A combination headed by the
Countess of Salisbury, if she were supported even by a small section of the
nobility, would under any circumstances have been dangerous; and if such a
combination was formed in support of an invasion, and was backed by the
blessings of the pope and the fanaticism of the clergy, the result might be
<span class="sidenote">Danger of a White Rose confederacy under the papal sanction.</span>

serious indeed. So careful a silence is observed in the official papers on
this feature of the Nun's conspiracy, that it is uncertain how far the
countess had committed herself; but she had listened certainly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> avowals
of treasonable intentions without revealing them, which of itself was no
slight evidence of disloyalty; and that the government were really alarmed
<span class="sidenote">Arrest of the Nevilles.</span>
may be gathered from the simultaneous arrest of Sir William and Sir George
Neville, the brothers of Lord Latimer. The connexion and significance of
these names I shall explain presently; in the meantime I return to the
preparations which had been made by the Nun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nun prophesies that the Lady Mary should have help when the
time was come.</div>

<p>As the final judgment drew near,&mdash;which, unless the king submitted, would
be accompanied with excommunication, and a declaration that the English
nation was absolved from allegiance,&mdash;"the said false Nun," says the
report, "surmised herself to have made a petition to God to know, when
fearful war should come, whether any man should take my Lady Mary's part or
no; and she feigned herself to have answer by revelation that no man should
fear but that she should have succour and help enough; and that no man
should put her from her right that she was born unto. And petitioning next
to know when it was the pleasure of God that her revelations should be put
forth to the world, she had answer that knowledge should be given to her
ghostly father when it should be time."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">She communicates with Queen Catherine,</div>

<p>With this information Father Goold had hastened down to Bugden, encouraging
Catherine to persevere in her resistance;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> imperialists
at Rome were pressing the pope for sentence (we cannot doubt at Catherine's
instance), the Nun had placed herself in readiness to seize the opportunity
when it offered, and to blow the trumpet of insurrection in the panic which
might be surely looked for when that sentence should be published.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And organizes a corps of Friars to preach insurrection.</div>

<p>For this purpose she had organized, with considerable skill, a corps of
fanatical friars, who, when the signal was given, were simultaneously to
throw themselves into the midst or the people, and call upon them to rise
in the name of God. "To the intent," says the report, "to set forth this
matter, certain spiritual and religious persons were appointed, as they had
been chosen of God, to preach the false revelations of the said Nun, when
the time should require, if warning were given them; and some of these
preachers have confessed openly, and subscribed their names to their
confessions, that if the Nun had so sent them word, they would have
preached to the king's subjects that the pleasure of God was that they
should take him no longer for their king; and some of these preachers were
such as gave themselves to great fasting, watching, long prayers, wearing
of shirts of hair and great chains of iron about their middle, whereby the
people had them in high estimation of their great holiness,&mdash;and this
strait life they took on them by the counsel and exhortation of the said
Nun."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">First Catholic treason.</div>

<p>Here, then, was the explanation of the attitude of Catherine and Mary.
Smarting under injustice, and most naturally blending their private quarrel
with the cause of the church, they had listened to these disordered visions
as to a message from heaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> and they had lent themselves to the first of
those religious conspiracies which held England in chronic agitation for
three quarters of a century. The innocent Saint at Bugden was the
forerunner of the prisoner at Fotheringay; and the Observant friars, with
their chain girdles and shirts of hair, were the antitypes of Parsons and
Campion. How critical the situation of England really was, appears from the
following letter of the French ambassador. The project for the marriage of
the Princess Mary with the Dauphin had been revived by the Catholic party;
and a private arrangement, of which this marriage was to form the
connecting link, was contemplated between the Ultramontanes in France, the
pope, and the emperor.</p>

<i>D'Inteville to Cardinal Tournon.</i><a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;You will be so good as to tell the Most Christian king that the
emperor's ambassador has communicated with the old queen. The emperor sends
a message to her and to her daughter, that he will not return to Spain till
he has seen them restored to their rights.</p>

<p>"The people are so much attached to the said ladies that they will rise in
rebellion, and join any prince who will undertake their quarrel. You
probably know from other quarters the intensity of this feeling. It is
shared by all classes, high and low, and penetrates even into the royal
household.</p>

<p>"The nation is in marvellous discontent. Every one but the relations of the
present queen, is indignant on the ladies' account. Some fear the overthrow
of religion; others fear war and injury to trade. Up to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> this time, the
cloth, hides, wool, lead, and other merchandize of England have found
markets in Flanders, Spain, and Italy; now it is thought navigation will be
so dangerous that English merchants must equip their ships for war if they
trade to foreign countries; and besides the risk of losing all to the
enemy, the expense of the armament will swallow the profits of the voyage.
In like manner, the emperor's subjects and the pope's subjects will not be
able to trade with England. The coasts will be blockaded by the ships of
the emperor and his allies; and at this moment men's fears are aggravated
by the unseasonable weather throughout the summer, and the failure of the
crops. There is not corn enough for half the ordinary consumption.</p>

<p>"The common people, foreseeing these inconveniences, are so violent against
the queen, that they say a thousand shameful things of her, and of all who
have supported her in her intrigues. On them is cast the odium of all the
calamities anticipated from the war.</p>

<p>"When the war comes, no one doubts that the people will rebel as much from
fear of the dangers which I have mentioned, as from the love which is felt
for the two ladies, and especially for the Princess. She is so entirely
beloved that, notwithstanding the law made at the last Parliament, and the
menace of death contained in it, they persist in regarding her as Princess.
No Parliament, they say, can make her anything but the king's daughter,
born in marriage; and so the king and every one else regarded her before
that Parliament.</p>

<p>"Lately, when she was removed from Greenwich, a vast crowd of women, wives
of citizens and others, walked before her at their husbands' desire,
weeping and crying that notwithstanding all she was Princess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> Some of them
were sent to the Tower, but they would not retract.</p>

<p>"Things are now so critical, and the fear of war is so general, that many
of the greatest merchants in London have placed themselves in communication
with the emperor's ambassador, telling him, that if the emperor will
declare war, the English nation will join him for the love they bear the
Lady Mary.</p>

<p>"You, my Lord, will remember that when you were here, it was said you were
come to tell the king that he was excommunicated, and to demand the hand of
the Princess for the Dauphin. The people were so delighted that they have
never ceased to pray for you. We too, when we arrived in London, were told
that the people were praying for us. They thought our embassy was to the
Princess. They imagined her marriage with the Dauphin had been determined
on by the two kings, and the satisfaction was intense and universal.</p>

<p>"They believe that, except by this marriage, they cannot possibly escape
war; whereas, can it be brought about, they will have peace with the
emperor and all other Christian princes. They are now so disturbed and so
desperate that, although at one time they would have preferred a husband
for her from among themselves, that they might not have a foreign king,
there now is nothing which they desire more. Unless the Dauphin will take
her, they say she will continue disinherited; or, if she come to her
rights, it can only be by battle, to the great incommodity of the country.
The Princess herself says publicly that the Dauphin is her husband, and
that she has no hope but in him. I have been told this by persons who have
heard it from her own lips.</p>

<p>"The emperor's ambassador inquired, after you came,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> whether we had seen
her. He said he knew she was most anxious to speak with us; she thought we
had permission to visit her, and she looked for good news. He told us,
among other things, that she had been more strictly guarded of late, by the
orders of the queen that now is, who, knowing her feeling for the Dauphin,
feared there might be some practice with her, or some attempt to carry her
off.</p>

<p>"The Princess's ladies say that she calls herself the Dauphin's wife. A
time will come, she says, when God will see that she has suffered pain and
tribulation sufficient; the Dauphin will then demand her of the king her
father, and the king her father will not be able to refuse.</p>

<p>"The lady who was my informant heard, also, from the Princess, that her
governess, and the other attendants whom the queen had set to watch her,
had assured her that the Dauphin was married to the daughter of the
emperor; but she, the Princess, had answered it was not true&mdash;the Dauphin
could not have two wives, and they well knew that she was his wife: they
told her that story, she said, to make her despair, and agree to give up
her rights; but she would never part with her hopes.</p>

<p>"You may have heard of the storm that broke out between her and her
governess when we went to visit her little sister. She was carried off by
force to her room, that she might not speak with us; and they could neither
pacify her nor keep her still, till the gentleman who escorted us told her
he had the king's commands that she was not to show herself while we were
in the house. You remember the message the same gentleman brought to you
from her, and the charge which was given by the queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could the king be brought to consent to the marriage, it would be a fair
union of two realms, and to annex Britain to the crown of France would be a
great honour to our Sovereign; the English party desire nothing better; the
pope will be glad of it; the pope fears that, if war break out again,
France will draw closer to England on the terms which the King of England
desires; and he may thus lose the French tribute as he has lost the
English. He therefore will urge the emperor to agree, and the emperor will
assist gladly for the love which he bears to his cousin.</p>

<p>"If the emperor be willing, the King of England can then be informed; and
he can be made to feel that, if he will avoid war, he must not refuse his
consent. The king, in fact, has no wish to disown the Princess, and he
knows well that the marriage with the Dauphin was once agreed on.</p>

<p>"Should he be unwilling, and should his wife's persuasions still have
influence with him, he will hesitate before he will defy, for her sake, the
King of France and the emperor united. His regard for the queen is less
than it was, and diminishes every day. He has a new fancy,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> as you are
aware."</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The actual conspiracy, in the form which it had so far assumed, was rather
an appeal to fanaticism than a plot which could have laid hold of the
deeper mind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> the country; but as an indication of the unrest which was
stealing over the minds of men, it assumed an importance which it would not
have received from its intrinsic character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nun and the five monks brought to trial.</div>

<p>The guilt of the principal offenders admitted of no doubt. As soon as the
commissioners were satisfied that there was nothing further to be
discovered, the Nun, with the monks, was brought to trial before the Star
Chamber; and conviction followed as a matter of
course.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The unhappy girl finding herself at this conclusion, after seven years of
vanity, in which she had played with popes, and queens, and princesses, and
archbishops, now, when the dream was thus rudely broken, in the revulsion
of feeling could see nothing in herself but a convicted impostor. We need
not refuse to pity her. The misfortunes of her sickness had exposed her to
temptations far beyond the strength of an ordinary woman; and the guilt
which she passionately claimed for herself rested far more truly with the
knavery of the Christ Church monks and the incredible folly of Archbishop
Warham.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
But the times were too stern to admit of nice distinctions. No
immediate sentence was pronounced, but it was thought desirable for the
satisfaction of the people that a confession should be made in public by
the Nun and her companions. The Sunday
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
following their trial they were
<span class="sidenote">They make their confessions at St. Paul's.</span>
placed on a raised platform at Paul's Cross by the side of the pulpit, and
when the sermon was over they one by one delivered their "bills" to the
preacher, which by him were read to the
crowd.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>After an acknowledgment of their imposture the prisoners were remanded to
the Tower, and their ultimate fate reserved for the consideration of
parliament, which was to meet in the middle of January.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The household of the Princess Mary is broken up.</div>

<p>The chief offenders being thus disposed of, the council resolved next that
peremptory measures should be taken with respect to the Princess
Mary.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Her establishment was broken up, and she was sent to reside as the Lady
Mary in the household of the Princess Elizabeth&mdash;a hard but not unwholesome
discipline.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
As soon as this was done, being satisfied that the leading
shoot of the conspiracy was broken, and that no immediate danger was now to
<span class="sidenote">The inquiry is prosecuted further.</span>
be feared, they proceeded leisurely to follow the clue of the Nun's
confession, and to extend their inquiries. The Countess of Salisbury was
mentioned as one of the persons with whom the woman had been in
correspondence. This lady was the daughter of the Duke of Clarence, brother
<span class="sidenote">The Countess of Salisbury.</span>
of Edward IV. Her mother was a Neville, a child of Richard the King-maker,
the famous Earl of Warwick, and her only brother had been murdered to
secure the shaking throne of Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> VII. Margaret Plantagenet, in
recompense for the lost honours of the house, was made Countess of
Salisbury in her own right. The title descended from her grandfather, who
was Earl of Salisbury and Warwick; but the prouder title had been dropped
as suggestive of dangerous associations. The Earldom of Warwick remained in
abeyance, and the castle and the estates attached to it were forfeited to
the Crown. The countess was married after her brother's death to a Sir
Richard Pole, a supporter and relation<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> of the king; and when left a
widow she received from Henry VIII. the respectful honour which was due to
the most nobly born of his subjects, the only remaining Plantagenet of
unblemished descent. In his kindness to her children the king had attempted
to obliterate the recollection of her brother's wrongs, and she had been
herself selected to preside over the household of the Princess Mary. During
the first twenty years of Henry's reign the countess seems to have
acknowledged his attentions with loyal regard, and if she had not forgotten
her birth and her childhood, she never connected herself with the attempts
which during that time were made to revive the feuds of the houses. Richard
de la Pole, nephew of Edward IV.,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and called while he lived "the White
Rose," had more than once endeavoured to excite an insurrection in the
eastern counties; but Lady Salisbury was never suspected of holding
intercourse with him; she remained aloof from political disputes, and in
lofty retirement she was contented to forget her greatness for the sake of
the Princess Mary, to whom she and her family were deeply attached. Her
relations with the king had thus continued undis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>turbed until his second
marriage. As the representative of the House of York she was the object of
the hopes and affections of the remnants of their party, but she had
betrayed no disposition to abuse her influence, or to disturb the quiet of
the nation for personal ambition of her own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reginald Pole.</div>

<p>If it be lawful to interpret symptoms in themselves trifling by the light
of later events, it would seem as if her attitude now underwent a material
change. Her son Reginald had already quarrelled with the king upon the
divorce. He was in suspicious connexion with the pope, and having been
required to return home upon his allegiance, had refused obedience. His
mother, and his mother's attached friend, the Marchioness of Exeter, we now
find among those to whom the Nun of Kent communicated her prophecies and
her plans. It does not seem that the countess thought at any time of
reviving her own pretensions; it does seem that she was ready to build a
throne for the Princess Mary out of the ruined supporters of her father's
family. The power which she could wield might at any moment become
<span class="sidenote">The Marquis of Exeter.</span>
formidable. She had two sons in England, Lord Montague and Sir Geoffrey
Pole. Her cousin, the Marquis of Exeter, a grandson himself of Edward
IV.,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
was, with the exception of the Duke of Norfolk, the most powerful
nobleman in the realm; and he, to judge by events, was beginning to look
coldly on the king.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
We find her surrounded also by the representatives
of her mother's family,&mdash;Lord Abergavenny, who had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> under suspicion
<span class="sidenote">The Nevilles.</span>
when the Duke of Buckingham was executed, Sir Edward Neville, afterwards
executed, Lord Latimer, Sir George and Sir William Neville, all of them
were her near connexions, all collateral heirs of the King-maker,
inheriting the pride of their birth, and resentfully conscious of their
fallen fortunes. The support of a party so composed would have added
formidable strength to the preaching friars of the Nun of Kent; and as I
cannot doubt that the Nun was endeavouring to press her intrigues in a
<span class="sidenote">The strength of the White Rose faction.</span>
quarter where disaffection if created would be most dangerous, so the lady
who ruled this party with a patriarchal authority had listened to her
suggestions; and the repeated interviews with her which, were sought by the
Marchioness of Exeter were rendered more than suspicious by the secresy
with which these interviews were conducted.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Examination on suspicion, of Sir William and Sir George
Neville.</div>

<p>These circumstances explain the arrest, to which I alluded above, of Sir
William and Sir George Neville, brothers of Lord Latimer. They were not
among "the many noblemen" to whom the commissioners referred; for their
confessions remain, and contain no allusion to the Nun; but they were
examined at this particular time on general suspicion; and the arrest,
under such circumstances, of two near relatives of Lady Salisbury,
indicates clearly an alarm in the council, lest she might be contemplating
some serious movements. At any rate, either on her account or on their own,
the Nevilles fell under suspicion, and while they had no crimes to reveal,
their depositions, especially that of Sir William Neville, furnish singular
evidence of the temper of the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confession of Sir William Neville.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
The confession of the latter begins with an account of the loss of certain
silver spoons, for the recovery of which Sir William sent to a wizard who
resided in Cirencester. The wizard took the opportunity of telling Sir
William's fortune: his wife was to die, and he himself was to marry an
heiress, and be made a baron; with other prospective splendours. The wizard
concluded, however, with recommending him to pay a visit to another dealer
in the dark art more learned than himself, whose name was Jones, at Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jones, the Oxford conjuror.</div>

<p>"So after that," said Sir William [Midsummer, 1532], "I went to Oxford,
intending that my brother George and I should kill a buck with Sir Simon
Harcourt, which he had promised me; and there at Oxford, in the said
Jones's chamber, I did see certain stillatories, alembics, and other
instruments of glass, and also a sceptre and other things, which he said
did appertain to the conjuration of the four kings; and also an image of
white metal; and in a box, a serpent's skin, as he said, and divers books
and things, whereof one was a book which he said was my Lord Cardinal's,
having pictures in it like angels. He told me he could make rings of gold,
to obtain favour of great men; and said that my Lord Cardinal had such; and
promised my said brother and me, either of us, one of them; and also he
showed me a round thing like a ball of crystal.</p>

<p>"He said that if the King's Grace went over to France [the Calais visit of
October, 1532], his Grace should marry my Lady Marchioness of Pembroke
before that his Highness returned again; and that it would be dangerous to
his Grace, and to the most part of the noblemen that should go with him;
saying also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> that he had written to one of the king's council to advise his
Highness not to go over, for if he did, it should not be for his Grace's
profit."</p>

<p>The wizard next pretended that he had seen a vision of a certain room in a
tower, in which a spirit had appeared with a coat of arms in his hand, and
had "delivered the same to Sir William Neville." The arms being described
as those of the Warwick family, Sir William, his brother, and Jones rode
down from Oxford to Warwick, where they went over the castle. The wizard
<span class="sidenote">The Nevilles to recover the Earldom of Warwick.</span>
professed to recognise in a turret chamber the room in which he had seen
the spirit, and he prophesied that Sir William should recover the earldom,
the long-coveted prize of all the Neville family.</p>

<p>On their return to Oxford, Jones, continues Sir William, said further,
"That there should be a field in the north about a se'nnight before
Christmas, in which my Lord my brother [Lord Latimer] should be slain; the
realm should be long without a king; and much robbery would be within the
realm, specially of abbeys and religious houses, and of rich men, as
merchants, graziers, and others; so that, if I would, he at that time would
advise me to find the means to enter into the said castle for mine own
<span class="sidenote">Prophecy that none of Cadwallader's blood should reign more than
twenty-four years.</span>
safeguard, and divers persons would resort unto me. <i>None of Cadwallader's
blood</i>, he told me, <i>should reign more than twenty-four years</i>; and also
that Prince Edward [son of Henry VI. and Margaret of Anjou, killed at
Tewkesbury] had issue a son which was conveyed over sea; and there had
issue a son which was yet alive, either in Saxony or Almayne; and that
either he or the King of Scots should reign next after the King's Grace
that now is. To all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> which I answered," Sir William concluded, "that there
is nothing which the will of God is that a man shall obtain, but that he of
his goodness will put in his mind the way whereby he shall come by it; and
that surely I had no mind to follow any such fashion; and that, also, the
late Duke of Buckingham and others had cast themselves away by too much
trust in prophecies, and other jeoparding of themselves, and therefore I
would in no wise follow any such way. He answered, if I would not, it would
be long ere I obtained it. Then I said I believed that well, and if it
never came, I trusted to God to live well
enough."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Sir George Neville confirmed generally his brother's story, protesting that
they had never intended treason, and that "at no time had he been of
counsel" when any treason was thought
of.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The wizard summoned before the Council.</div>

<p>The wizard himself was next sent for. The prophecies about the king he
denied wholly. He admitted that he had seen an angel in a dream giving Sir
William Neville the shield of the earldom in Warwick Castle, and that he
had accompanied the two brothers to Warwick, to examine the tower. Beyond
that, he said that he knew nothing either of them or of their intentions.
<span class="sidenote">He undertakes to make the philosopher's stone, and will jeopard
his life upon it.</span>
He declared himself a good subject, and he would "jeopard his life" to make
the philosopher's stone for the king in twelve months if the king pleased
to command him. He desired "no longer space than twelve months upon silver
and twelve and a half upon gold "; to be kept in prison till he had done
it; and it would be "better to the King's Grace than a thousand
men."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence in these confessions of the unrest and agitation of the
country.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
The result of these examinations does not appear, except it be that the
Nevilles were dismissed without punishment; and the story itself may be
thought too trifling to have deserved a grave notice. I see in it, however,
an illustration very noticeworthy of the temper which was working in the
country. The suspicion of treason in the Neville family may not have been
confirmed, although we see them casting longing looks on the lost
inheritance of Warwick; but their confessions betray the visions of
impending change, anarchy, and confusion, which were haunting the popular
imagination. A craving after prophecies, a restless eagerness to search
into the future by abnormal means, had infected all ranks from the highest
to the lowest; and such symptoms, when they appear, are a sure evidence of
approaching disorder, for they are an evidence of a present madness which
has brought down wisdom to a common level with folly. At such times, the
idlest fancy is more potent with the mind than the soundest arguments of
reason. The understanding abdicates its functions; and men are given over,
as if by magic, to the enchantments of insanity.</p>

<p>Phenomena of this eccentric kind always accompany periods of intellectual
change. Most men live and think by habit; and when habit fails them, they
are like unskilful sailors who have lost the landmarks of their course, and
have no compass and no celestial charts by which to steer. In the years
which preceded the French Revolution, Cagliostro was the companion of
princes,&mdash;at the dissolution of paganism the practicers of curious arts,
the witches and the necromancers, were the sole objects of reverence in the
Roman world; and so, before the Reformation, archbishops and car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>dinals saw
an inspired prophetess in a Kentish servant-girl; Oxford heads of colleges
sought out heretics with the help of astrology; Anne Boleyn blessed a basin
of rings, her royal fingers pouring such virtue into the metal that no
disorder could resist it;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Wolsey had a magic crystal; and Cromwell,

These things were the counterpart of a religion which taught that slips of
paper, duly paid for, could secure indemnity for sin. It was well for
England that the chief captain at least was proof against the epidemic&mdash;no
random scandal seems ever to have whispered that such delusions had touched
the mind of the king.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king incurs the censures of the church.</div>

<p>While the government were prosecuting these inquiries at home, the law at
the Vatican had run its course; November passed, and as no submission had
arrived, the sentence of the 12th of July came into force, and the king,
the queen, and the Archbishop of Canterbury were declared to have incurred
the threatened censures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Measures of the Council.</div>

<p>The privy council met on the 2d of December, and was determined in
consequence that copies of the "Act of Appeals," and of the king's
"provocation" to a general council, should be fixed without delay on every
church-door in England. Protests were at the same time to be drawn up and
sent into Flanders, and to the other courts in Europe, "to the intent the
falsehood and injustice of the Bishop of Rome might appear to all the
world." The defences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of the country were to be looked to; and "spies" to
be sent into Scotland to see "what they intended there," "and whether they
<span class="sidenote">Renewed suggestion of a Protestant league.</span>
would confeder themselves with any outward princes." Finally, it was
proposed that the attempt to form an alliance with the Lutheran powers
should be renewed on a larger scale; that certain discreet and grave
persons should be appointed to conclude "some league or amity with the
princes of Germany,"&mdash;"that is to say, the King of Poland, the King of
Hungary,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> the Duke of Saxony, the Duke of Bavaria, the Duke of
Brandenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, and other potentates."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Vaughan's
mission had been merely tentative, and had failed. Yet the offer of a
league, offensive and defensive, the immediate and avowed object of which
was a general council at which the Protestants should be represented, might
easily succeed where vague offers of amity had come to nothing. The
formation of a Protestant alliance, however, would have been equivalent to
a declaration of war against Catholic Europe; and it was a step which could
not be taken, consistently with the Treaty of Calais, without first
communicating with Francis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King writes to Francis, menacing him with this expedient.</div>

<p>Henry, therefore, by the advice of the council, wrote a despatch to Sir
John Wallop, the ambassador at Paris, which was to be laid before the
French court. He explained the circumstances in which he was placed, with
the suggestion which the council had made to him. He gave a list of the
princes with whom he had been desired by his ministers to connect
himself,&mdash;and the object was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">December 2.</span>
nothing less than a coalition of Northern
Europe. He recapitulated the injuries which he had received from the pope,
who at length was studying "to subvert the rest and peace of the realm ";
"yea, and so much as in him was, utterly to destroy the same." The nobles
<span class="sidenote">A Protestant alliance highly desirable to put an end to the
usurpation of the pope.</span>
and council, he said, for their own sake as well as for the sake of the
kingdom, had entreated him to put an end, once for all, to the pope's
usurpation; and to invite the Protestant princes, for the universal weal of
Christendom, to unite in a common alliance. In his present situation he was
inclined to act upon this advice. "As concerning his own realm, he had
already taken such order with his nobles and subjects, as he would shortly
be able to give to the pope such a buffet as he never had heretofore; "but
as a German alliance was a matter of great weight and importance,
<span class="sidenote">He will not act, however, without first consulting his good
brother.</span>
"although," he concluded, "we consider it to be right expedient to set
forth the same with all diligence, yet we intend nothing to do therein
without making our good brother first privy thereunto. And for this cause
and consideration only, you may say that we have at this time addressed
these letters unto you, commanding you to declare our said purpose unto our
good brother, and to require of him on our behalf his good address and best
advice. Of his answer we require you to advertise us with all diligence,
for according thereunto we intend to attemper our proceedings. We have
lately had advertisements how that our said good brother should, by the
labour of divers affectionate Papists, be minded to set forth something
with his clergy in advancement of the pope and his desires. This we cannot
believe that he will
do."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning of this letter. He will join Germany sooner than yield
to the pope, but he trusts that Francis will not drive him to it.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
The meaning of this letter lies upon the surface. If the European powers
were determined to leave him no alternative, the king was prepared to ally
himself with the Lutherans. But however he might profess to desire that
alliance, it was evident that he would prefer, if possible, a less extreme
resource. The pope had ceased to be an object of concern to him; but he
could not contemplate, without extreme unwillingness, a separation from the
orderly governments who professed the Catholic faith. The pope had injured
him; Francis had deceived him; they had tempted his patience because they
knew his disposition. The limit of endurance had been reached at length;
yet, on the verge of the concluding rupture, he turned once more, as if to
offer a last opportunity of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mission of the Bishop of Paris to England.</div>

<p>The reply of Francis was an immediate mission of the Bishop of Bayonne (now
Bishop of Paris), first into England, and from England to Rome, where he
was to endeavour, to the best of his ability, to seam together the already
gaping rent in the church with fair words&mdash;a hopeless task&mdash;the results of
which, however, were unexpectedly considerable, as will be presently seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Threatening attitude of the Court of Brussels.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the side of Flanders, the atmosphere was dubious and
menacing. The refugee friars, who were reported to be well supplied with
money from England, were labouring to exasperate the people, Father Peto
especially distinguishing himself upon this service.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The English
ambassador,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Sir John Hacket, still remained at Brussels, and the two
governments were formally at peace; but when Hacket required the

queen-regent to forbid the publication of the brief of July in the
Netherlands, he was met with a positive refusal. "M. Ambassador," she said,
"the Emperor, the King of Hungary, the Queen of France, the King of
Portugal, and I, understand what are the rights of our aunt&mdash;our duty is to
her&mdash;and such letters of the pope as come hither in her favour we shall
obey. Your master has no right to complain either of the emperor or of
myself, if we support our aunt in a just cause."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
At the same time,
formal complaints were made by Charles of the personal treatment of Queen
Catherine, and the clouds appeared to be gathering for a storm. Yet here,
too, there was an evident shrinking from extremities. A Welsh gentleman had
<span class="sidenote">December 15.</span>
been at Brussels to offer his services against Henry, and had met with
apparent coldness. Sir John Hacket wrote, on the 15th of December, that he
was assured by well-informed persons, that so long as Charles lived, he
would never be the first to begin a war with England, "which would rebound
to the destruction of the Low
Countries."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
<span class="sidenote">December 23.</span>
A week later, when the
queen-regent was suffering from an alarming illness, he said it was
reported that, should she die, Catherine or Mary, if either of them was
allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to leave England, would be held "meet to have governance of the
Low Countries."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Proposal to make Catherine or Mary Regent of the Netherlands.</span>
This was a generous step, if the emperor seriously
contemplated it. The failure of the Nun of Kent had perhaps taught him that
there was no present prospect of a successful insurrection. In his conduct
towards England, he was seemingly governing himself by the prospect which
might open for a successful attack upon it. If occasion offered to strike
<span class="sidenote">Charles waiting upon events.</span>
the government in connexion with an efficient Catholic party in the nation
itself, he would not fail to avail himself of
it.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Otherwise, he would
perhaps content himself with an attitude of inactive menace; unless menaced
himself by a Protestant confederation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">January 15. Meeting of parliament.</div>

<p>Amidst these uneasy symptoms at home and abroad, parliament reassembled on
the 15th of January. It was a changed England since these men first came
together on the fall of Wolsey. Session after session had been spent in
clipping the roots of the old tree which had overshadowed them for
centuries. On their present meeting they were to finish their work, and lay
it prostrate for ever. Negotiations were still pending with the See of
Rome, and this momentous session had closed before the final catastrophe.
The measures which were passed in the course of it are not, therefore, to
be looked upon as adopted hastily, in a spirit of retaliation, but as the
consistent accomplishment of a course which had been deliberately adopted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to reverse the positions of the civil and spiritual authority within the
realm, and to withdraw the realm itself from all dependence on a foreign
power.</p>

<p>The Annates and Firstfruits' Bill had not yet received the royal assent;
but the pope had refused to grant the bulls for bishops recently appointed,
and he was no longer to receive payment for services which he refused to
render. Peter's pence were still paid, and might continue to be paid, if
the pope would recollect himself; but, like the Sibyl of Cuma, Henry
destroyed some fresh privilege with each delay of justice, demanding the
same price for the preservation of what remained. The secondary streams of
tribute now only remained to the Roman See; and communion with the English
church, which it was for Clement to accept or refuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opening business of the session.</div>

<p>The circumstances under which the session opened were, however, grave and
saddening. Simultaneously with the concluding legislation on the church,
the succession to the throne was to be determined in terms which might,
perhaps, be accepted as a declaration of war by the emperor; and the affair
of the Nun of Kent had rendered necessary an inquiry into the conduct of
honoured members of the two Houses, who were lying under the shadow of high
<span class="sidenote">Perils of the Reformation.</span>
treason. The conditions were for the first time to be plainly seen under
which the Reformation was to fight its way. The road which lay before it
was beset not merely with external obstacles, which a strong will and a
strong hand could crush, but with the phantoms of dying faiths, which
haunted the hearts of all living men; the superstitions, the prejudices,
the hopes, the fears, the passions, which swayed stormily and fitfully
through the minds of every actor in the great drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cromwell only sees his way clearly.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
The uniformity of action in the parliament of 1529, during the seven years
which it continued, is due to the one man who saw his way distinctly,
Thomas Cromwell. The nation was substantially united on the divorce
question, could the divorce be secured without a rupture with the European
powers. It was united also on the necessity of limiting the jurisdiction of
the clergy, and cutting short the powers of the consistory courts. But in
questions of "opinion" there was the most sensitive jealousy; and from the
combined instincts of prejudice and conservatism, the majority of the
country in a count of heads would undoubtedly have been against a
separation from Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Struggle in Henry's mind between light and darkness.</div>

<p>The clergy professed to approve the acts of the government, but it was for
the most part with the unwilling acquiescence of men who were without
courage to refuse. The king was divided against himself. Nine days in ten
he was the clear-headed, energetic, powerful statesman; on, the tenth he
was looking wistfully to the superstition which he had left, and the clear
sunshine was darkened with theological clouds, which broke in lightning and
<span class="sidenote">Danger of reaction.</span>
persecution. Thus there was danger at any moment of a reaction, unless
opportunity was taken at the flood, unless the work was executed too
completely to admit of reconsideration, and the nation committed to a
course from which it was impossible to recede. The action of the
conservatives was paralysed for the time by the want of a fixed purpose.
The various parts of the movement were so skilfully linked together, that
partial opposition to it was impossible; and so long as the people had to
choose between the pope and the king, their loyalty would not allow them to
hesitate. But very few men actively adhered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to Cromwell. Cromwell had
<span class="sidenote">Peculiarity of Cromwell's genius.</span>
struck the line on which the forces of nature were truly moving,&mdash;the
resultant, not of the victory of either of the extreme parties, but of the
joint action of their opposing forces. To him belonged the rare privilege
of genius, to see what other men could not see; and therefore he was
condemned to rule a generation which hated him, to do the will of God, and
to perish in his success. He had no party. By the nobles he was regarded
with the same mixed contempt and fear which had been felt for Wolsey. The
Protestants, perhaps, knew what he was, but he could only purchase their
toleration by himself checking their extravagance. Latimer was the only
person of real power on whose friendship he could calculate, and Latimer
was too plain-spoken on dangerous questions to be useful as a political
supporter.</p>

<p>The session commenced on the 15th of January.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The clergy make their final submission.</div>

<p>The first step was to receive the final submission of convocation. The
undignified resistance was at last over, and the clergy had promised to
abstain for the future from unlicensed legislation. To secure their
adherence to their engagements, an
act<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
was passed to make the breach
<span class="sidenote">Mixed Commission, intended for the revision of the Canon law.</span>
of that engagement penal; and a commission of thirty-two persons, half of
whom were to be laymen, was designed for the revision of the Canon
law.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reform in the law for the prosecution of heretics.</div>

<p>The next most important movement was to assimilate the trials for heresy
with the trials for other criminal offences. I have already explained at
length the manner in which the bishops abused their judicial powers. These
powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> were not absolutely taken away, but ecclesiastics were no longer
permitted to arrest <i>ex officio</i> and examine at their pleasure. Where a
charge of heresy was to be brought against a man, presentments were to be
made by lawful witnesses before justices of the peace; and then, and not
otherwise, he might fall under the authority of the "ordinary." Secret
examinations were declared illegal. The offender was to be tried in open
court, and, previous to his trial, had a right to be admitted to bail,
unless the bishop could show cause to the contrary to the satisfaction of
two magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>This was but a slight instalment of lenity; but it was an indication of the
turning tide. Limited as it was, the act operated as an effective check
upon persecution till the passing of the Six Articles Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Annates Act having received the royal assent,</div>

<p>Turning next to the relations between England and Rome, the parliament
reviewed the Annates Act,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
which had been left unratified in the hope
that the pope might have consented to a compromise, and that "by some
gentle ways the said exaction might have been redressed and reformed." The
expectation had been disappointed. The pope had not condescended to reply
to the communication which had been made to him, and the act had in
<span class="sidenote">An alteration is necessary in the mode of electing bishops.</span>
consequence received the royal assent. An alteration had thus become
necessary in the manner of presentation to vacant bishoprics. The anomalies
of the existing practice have been already described. By the Great Charter
the chapters had acquired the right of free election. A <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> was
granted by the king on the occurrence of a vacancy, with no attempt at a
nomination. The chapters were supposed to make their choice freely, and the
name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of the bishop-elect was forwarded to the pope, who returned the
Pallium and the Bulls, receiving the Annates in exchange. The pope's part
in the matter was now terminated. No Annates would be sent any longer to
Rome, and no Bulls would be returned from Rome. The appointments lay
<span class="sidenote">The Chapters had gradually lost the privileges granted to them
by the Great Charter.</span>
between the chapters and the crown; and it might have seemed, at first
sight, as if it would have been sufficient to omit the reference to the
papacy, and as if the remaining forms might continue as they were. The
chapters, however, had virtually long ceased to elect freely; the crown had
absorbed the entire functions of presentation, sometimes appointing
foreigners,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
sometimes allowing the great ecclesiastical ministers to
nominate themselves;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
while the rights of the chapters, though existing
in theory, were not officially recognised either by the pope or by the
crown. The king affected to accept the names of the prelates-elect, when
returned to him from Rome, as nominations by the pope; and the pope, in
<span class="sidenote">The nomination had virtually rested with the crown.</span>
communicating with the chapters, presented them with their bishops as from
himself.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The papal share in the matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was a shadow, but it was
acknowledged under the forms of courtesy; the share of the chapters was
wholly and absolutely ignored. The crisis of a revolution was not the
moment at which their legal privileges could be safely restored to them.
The problem of re-arrangement was a difficult one, and it was met in a
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty of re-arrangement. The <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i>.</span>
manner peculiarly English. The practice of granting the <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> to

desuetude, was again adopted, and the church resumed the forms of liberty:
but the licence to elect a bishop was to be accompanied with the name of
the person whom the chapter was required to elect; and if within twelve
days the person so named had not been chosen, the nomination of the crown
was to become absolute, and the chapter would incur a Premunire.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter's Pence and other forms of tribute paid to Rome
abolished.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
This act, which I conceive to have been more arbitrary in form than in
intention, was followed by a closing attack upon the remaining "exactions"
of the Bishop of Rome. The Annates were gone. There were yet to go,
"Pensions, Censes, Peter's Pence, Procurations, Fruits, Suits for
Provision, Delegacies and Rescripts in causes of Contention and Appeals,
Jurisdictions legatine&mdash;also Dispensations, Licenses, Faculties, Grants,
Relaxations, Writs called Perinde valere, Rehabilitations, Abolitions,"
with other unnamed (the parliament being wearied of naming them) "infinite
sorts of Rules, Briefs, and instruments of sundry natures, names, and
kinds." All these were perennially open sluices, which had drained England
of its wealth for centuries, returning only in showers of paper; and the
Commons were determined that streams so unremunerative should flow no
longer. They conceived that they had been all along imposed upon, and that
the "Bishop of Rome was to be blamed for having allured and beguiled the
English nation, persuading them that he had power to dispense with human
<span class="sidenote">Conditional abolition of the papal authority in England.</span>
laws, uses, and customs, contrary to right and conscience." If the king so
pleased, therefore, they would not be so beguiled any more. These and all
similar exactions should cease; and all powers claimed by the Bishop of
Rome within the realm should cease, and should be transferred to the crown.
At the same time they would not press upon the pope too hardly; they would
repeat the same conditions which they had offered with the Annates. He had
received these revenues as the supreme judge in the highest court in
Europe, and he might retain his revenues or receive compensation for them,
if he dared to be just. It
<span class="sidenote">Three months allowed to the pope to decide.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
was for himself to resolve, and three months
allowed for a final decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commons make a general declaration that in separating from
the pope, they are not separating from the unity of the faith.</div>

<p>In conclusion, the Commons thought it well to assert that they were
separating, not from the church of Christ, but only from the papacy. A
judge who allowed himself to be overawed against his conscience by a
secular power, could not any longer be recognised; but no thing or things
contained in the act should be afterwards "interpreted or expounded, that
his Grace (the king), his nobles and subjects, intended by the same to
decline or vary from the congregation of Christ's church in anything
concerning the articles of the Catholic faith of Christendom, or in any
other things declared by the Holy Scripture and the Word of God necessary
for salvation; but only to make an ordinance, by policies necessary and
convenient, to repress vice, and for the good conservation of the realm in
peace, unity, and tranquillity, from ravin and spoil&mdash;ensuing much the old
antient customs of the realm in that behalf."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">February 18.</div>

<p>The most arduous business was thus finished&mdash;the most painful remained. The
Nun of Kent and her accomplices were to be proceeded against by act of
parliament; and the bill of their attainder was presented for the first
time in the House of Lords, on the 18th of February. The offence of the
<span class="sidenote">Bill of attainder against the Nun of Kent and her accomplices.</span>
principal conspirators was plainly high treason; their own confessions
removed uncertainty; the guilt was clear&mdash;the sentence was inevitable. But
the fault of those who had been listeners only was less easy of
measurement, and might vary from comparative innocence to a definite breach
of allegiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
The government were unwilling to press with severity on the noble lords and
ladies whose names had been unexpectedly brought to light; and there were
two men of high rank only, whose complicity it was thought necessary to
notice. The Bishop of Rochester's connexion with the Nun had been culpably
encouraging; and the responsibility of Sir Thomas More was held also to be
very great in having countenanced, however lightly, such perilous schemers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Declared in the first reading of the bill guilty of misprision
of treason.</div>

<p>In the bill, therefore, as it was first read, More and Fisher found
themselves declared guilty of misprision of treason. But the object of this
measure was rather to warn than to punish, nor was there any real intention
of continuing their prosecution. Cromwell, under instructions from the
king, had communicated privately with both of them. He had sent a message
to Fisher through his brother, telling him that he had only to ask for
<span class="sidenote">Private communications are made to them by Cromwell that the
king will accept their apology.</span>
forgiveness to receive
it;<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
and he had begged More through his
son-in-law, Mr. Roper, to furnish him with an explicit account of what had
passed at any time between himself and the
Nun,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
with an intimation
that, if honestly made, it would be accepted in his favour.</p>

<p>These advances were met by More in the spirit in which they were offered.
He heartily thanked Cromwell, "reckoning himself right deeply beholden to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Sir Thomas More complies elaborately and reasonably.</span>
him;"<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
and replied with a long, minute, and evidently veracious story,
detailing an interview which he had held with the woman in the chapel of
Sion Monastery. He sent at the same time a copy of a letter which he had
written to her, and described various conversations with the friars who
were concerned in the forgery. He did not deny that he had believed the Nun
to have been inspired, or that he had heard of the language which she was
in the habit of using respecting the king. He protested, however, that he
had himself never entertained a treasonable thought. He told Cromwell that
"he had done a very meritorious deed in bringing forth to light such
detestable hypocrisy, whereby every other wretch might take warning, and be
feared to set forth their devilish dissembled falsehoods under the manner
and colour of the wonderful work of
God."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
More's offence had not been
great. His acknowledgments were open and unreserved; and Cromwell laid his
letter before the king, adding his own intercession that the matter might
<span class="sidenote">More is pardoned.</span>
be passed over. Henry consented, expressing only his grief and concern that
Sir Thomas More should have acted so
unwisely.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
He required,
nevertheless, as Cromwell suggested, that a formal letter should be
written, with a confession of fault, and a request for forgiveness. More
obeyed; he wrote, gracefully reminding the king of a promise when he
resigned the chancellorship, that in any suit which he might afterwards
have to his Grace, either touching his honour or his profit, he should find
his Highness his good and gracious lord.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Henry ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>knowledged his
claim; his name was struck out of the bill, and the prosecution against him
was dropped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fisher is obstinate. His fault had been deeper than More's; yet
he undertakes to defend it.</div>

<p>Fisher's conduct was very different; his fault had been far greater than
More's, and promises more explicit had been held out to him of forgiveness.
He replied to these promises by an elaborate and ridiculous defence,&mdash;not
writing to the king, as Cromwell desired him, but vindicating himself as
having committed no fault; although he had listened eagerly to language
which was only pardonable on the assumption that it was inspired, and had
encouraged a nest of fanatics by his childish credulity. The Nun "had
showed him not," he said, "that any prince or temporal lord should put the
king in danger of his crown." He knew nothing of the intended insurrection.
<span class="sidenote">Folly of his position;</span>
He believed the woman to have been a saint; he supposed that she had
herself told the king all which she had told to him; and therefore he said
that he had nothing for which to reproach himself.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> He was unable to
see that the exposure of the imposture had imparted a fresh character to
his conduct, which he was bound to regret. Knowingly or unknowingly, he had
lent his countenance to a conspiracy; and so long as he refused to
acknowledge his indiscretion, the government necessarily would interpret
his actions in the manner least to his advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Which Cromwell exposes,</div>

<p>If he desired that his conduct should be forgotten, it was indispensable
that he should change his attitude, and so Cromwell warned him. "Ye
desire," the latter wrote, "for the passion of Christ, that ye be no more
quickened in this matter; for if ye be put to that strait ye will not lose
your soul, but ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> will speak as your conscience leadeth you; with many
more words of great courage. My Lord, if ye had taken my counsel sent unto
you by your brother, and followed the same, submitting yourself by your
letter to the King's Grace for your offences in this behalf, I would have
trusted that ye should never be quickened in the matter more. But now where
ye take upon you to defy the whole matter as ye were in no default, I
<span class="sidenote">And once more urges him to apologize.</span>
cannot so far promise you. Wherefore, my Lord, I would eftsoons advise you
that, laying apart all such excuses as ye have alleged in your letters,
which in my opinion be of small effect, ye beseech the King's Grace to be
your gracious lord, and to remit unto you your negligence, oversight, and
offence committed against his Highness in this behalf; and I dare undertake
that his Highness shall benignly accept you into his gracious favour, all
matter of displeasure past afore this time forgotten and forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fisher again refuses, and sends in his defence to the House of
Lords.</div>

<p>Fisher must have been a hopelessly impracticable person. Instead of
following More's example, and accepting well-meant advice, he persisted in
the same tone, and drew up an address to the House of Lords, in which he
repeated the defence which he had made to Cromwell. He expressed no sorrow
that he had been engaged in a criminal intrigue, no pleasure that the
intrigue had been discovered; and he doggedly adhered to his assertions of
his own innocence.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">March 6. The bill passes.</div>

<p>There was nothing to be done except to proceed with his attainder. The bill
passed three readings, and the various prisoners were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
summoned to the Star
Chamber to be heard in arrest of judgment. The Bishop of Rochester's
attendance was dispensed with on the ground of illness, and because he had
made his defence in
writing.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
Nothing of consequence was urged by
either of the accused. The bill was most explicit in its details, going
carefully through the history of the imposture, and dwelling on the
separate acts of each offender. They were able to disprove no one of its
clauses, and on the 12th of March it was read a last time. On the 21st it
received the royal assent, and there remained only to execute the sentence.
<span class="sidenote">The Nun and the monks to be executed. The Bishop of Rochester
and Father Abel to be imprisoned with forfeiture of goods.</span>
The Nun herself, Richard Masters, and the five friars being found guilty of
high treason, were to die; the Bishop of Rochester, Father Abel, Queen
Catherine's confessor, and four more, were sentenced for misprision of
treason to forfeiture of goods and imprisonment. All other persons
implicated, whose names did not appear, were declared pardoned at the
intercession of Queen Anne.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

all persons who will risk their lives in an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>selfish cause. For the Nun
herself, we may feel even a less qualified regret. Before her death she was
permitted to speak a few words to the people, which at the distance of
three centuries will not be read without emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last words of the Nun at Tyburn.</div>

<p>"Hither am I come to die," she said, "and I have not been the only cause of
mine own death, which most justly I have deserved; but also I am the cause
of the death of all these persons which at this time here suffer. And yet I
am not so much to be blamed, considering that it was well known unto these
learned men that I was a poor wench without learning; and therefore they
might have easily perceived that the things which were done by me could not
proceed in no such sort; but their capacities and learning could right well
judge that they were altogether feigned. But because the things which I
feigned were profitable unto them, therefore they much praised me, and bare
me in hand that it was the Holy Ghost and not I that did them. And I being
puffed up with their praises, fell into a pride and foolish fantasye with
myself, and thought I might feign what I would, which thing hath brought me
to this case, and for the which I now cry God and the King's Highness most
heartily mercy, and desire all you good people to pray to God to have mercy
on me, and on all them that here suffer with me."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act of Succession.</div>

<p>And now the closing seal was to be affixed to the agitation of the great
question of the preceding years. I have said that throughout these years
the uncertainty of the succession had been the continual anxiety of the
nation. The birth of a prince or princess could alone provide an absolute
security; and to beget a prince appeared to be the single feat which Henry
<span class="sidenote">The necessity of it.</span>
was unable to accomplish. The marriage so dearly bought had been followed
as yet only by a girl; and if the king were to die, leaving two daughters
circumstanced as Mary and Elizabeth were circumstanced, a dispute would
open which the sword only could decide. To escape the certainty of civil
war, therefore, it was necessary to lay down the line of inheritance by a
peremptory order; to cut off resolutely all rival claims; and, in
legislating upon a matter so vital, and hitherto so uncertain and
indeterminate, to enforce the decision with the most stringent and exacting
penalties. From the Heptarchy downwards English history furnished no fixed
rule of inheritance, but only a series of precedents of uncertainty; and
while at no previous time had the circumstances of the succession been of a
nature so legitimately embarrassing, the relations of England with the pope
and with foreign powers doubly enhanced the danger. But I will not use my
own language on so important a subject. The preamble of the Act of
Succession is the best interpreter of the provisions of that act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inasmuch as the only unquestioned title to the throne lies in
the king, and in his natural heirs;</div>

<p>"In their most humble wise show unto your Majesty your most humble and
obedient subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons, in
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
present parliament assembled; that since it is the natural
inclination of every man gladly and willingly to provide for the safety of
both his title and succession, although it touch only his private cause; we
therefore, most rightful and dreadful Sovereign Lord, reckon ourselves much
more bounden to beseech and intreat your Highness (although we doubt not of
your princely heart and wisdom, mixed with a natural affection to the same)
to foresee and provide for the most perfect surety of both you and of your
most lawful successors and heirs, upon which dependeth all our joy and
wealth; in whom also is united and knit the only mere true inheritance and
<span class="sidenote">And inasmuch as in times past a disputed succession has on many
occasions caused confusion and bloodshed in the realm,</span>
title of this realm without any contradiction. We, your said most humble
and obedient servants, call to our remembrance the great divisions which in
times past hath been in this realm by reason of several titles pretended to
the imperial crown of the same; which some time and for the most part
ensued by occasion of ambiguity, and [by] doubts then not so perfectly
declared but that men might upon froward intents expound them to every
man's sinister appetite and affection after their senses; whereof hath
ensued great destruction and effusion of man's blood, as well of a great
number of the nobles as of other the subjects and specially inheritors in
<span class="sidenote">Because there has been no fixed order or rule of inheritance,</span>
the same. The greatest occasion thereof hath been because no perfect and
substantial provision by law hath been made within this realm itself when
doubts and questions have been moved; by reason whereof the Bishops of Rome
and See Apostolic have presumed in times past to invest who should please
them to inherit in other men's kingdoms and dominions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
which thing we your
most humble subjects, both spiritual and temporal, do much abhor and
<span class="sidenote">And because the intrigues of the popes and of foreign princes
have created sedition and confusion,</span>
detest. And sometimes other foreign princes and potentates of sundry
degrees, minding rather dissension and discord to continue in the realm
than charity, equity, or unity, have many times supported wrong titles,
whereby they might the more easily and facilly aspire to the superiority of
the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's subjects intreat his Highness for their better
security after his death, that it may be enacted by authority of
parliament:</div>

<p>"The continuance and sufferance of these things, deeply considered and
pondered, is too dangerous and perilous to be suffered any longer; and too
much contrary to unity, peace, and tranquillity, being greatly reproachable
and dishonourable to the whole realm. And in consideration thereof, your
said subjects, calling further to their remembrance, that the good unity,
peace, and wealth of the realm, specially and principally, above all
worldly things, consisteth in the surety and certainty of the procreation
and posterity of your Highness, in whose most Royal person at this time is
no manner of doubt, do therefore most humbly beseech your Highness that it
may be enacted, with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and
the Commons in this present parliament assembled&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. That the marriage with the Lady Catherine was invalid from
the beginning.</div>

<p>"1. That the marriage between your Highness and the Lady Catherine, widow
of the late Prince Arthur, be declared to have been from the beginning,
null, the issue of it illegitimate, the separation pronounced by the
Archbishop of Canterbury good and valid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. That the marriage with Queen Anne is good and sincere.</div>

<p>"2. That the marriage between your Highness and your most dear and entirely
beloved wife, Queen Anne, be established and held good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> and taken for
undoubtful, true, sincere, and perfect, ever hereafter."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">That the issue of the king by Queen Anne shall succeed,</div>

<p>The act then assumed a general character, laying down a table of prohibited
degrees, within which marriage might not under any pretence be in future
contracted; and demanding that any marriage which might already exist
within those degrees should be at once dissolved. After this provision, it
again returned to the king, and fixed the order in which his children by
Queen Anne were to succeed. The details of the regulations were minute and
elaborate, and the rule to be observed was the same as that which exists at
present. First, the sons were to succeed with their heirs; if sons failed,
then the daughters, with their heirs. And, in conclusion, it was resolved,
<span class="sidenote">And that whoever by word or deed impugned the legitimacy of that
issue, shall be held guilty of treason.</span>
that any person who should maliciously do anything by writing, printing, or
other external act or deed to the peril of the king, or to the prejudice of
his marriage with Queen Anne, or to the derogation of the issue of that
marriage, should be held guilty of high treason; and whoever should speak
against that marriage, should be held guilty of misprision of
treason;&mdash;severe enactments, such as could not be justified at ordinary
times, and such as, if the times had been ordinary, would not have been
thought necessary; but the exigencies of the country could not tolerate an
uncertainty of title in the heir to the crown; and the title could only be
secured by prohibiting absolutely the discussion of dangerous questions.</p>

<p>The mere enactment of a statute, whatever penalties were attached to the
violation of it, was still, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> an insufficient safeguard. The recent
investigation had revealed a spirit of disloyalty, where such a spirit had
not been expected. The deeper the inquiry had penetrated, the more clearly
appeared tokens, if not of conspiracy, yet of excitement, of doubt, of
agitation, of alienated feeling, if not of alienated act. All the symptoms
were abroad which provide disaffection with its opportunity; and in the
natural confusion which attended the revolt from the papacy, the
obligations of duty, both political and religious, had become indefinite
and contradictory, pointing in all directions, like the magnetic needle in
a thunderstorm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All persons, at the king's pleasure, liable to be called upon to
swear to this act.</div>

<p>It was thought well, therefore, to vest a power in the crown, of trying the
tempers of suspected persons, and examining them upon oath, as to their
willingness to maintain the decision of parliament. This measure was a
natural corollary of the statute, and depended for its justification on the
extent of the danger to which the state was exposed. If a difference of
opinion on the legitimacy of the king's children, or of the pope's power in
England, was not dangerous, it was unjust to interfere with the natural
liberty of speech or thought. If it was dangerous, and if the state had
cause for supposing that opinions of the kind might spread in secret so
long as no opportunity was offered for detecting their progress, to require
the oath was a measure of reasonable self-defence, not permissible only,
but in a high degree necessary and right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A commission appointed to take the examination.</div>

<p>Under the impression, then, that the circumstances of the country demanded
extraordinary precautions, a commission was appointed, consisting of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, and
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> Duke of Suffolk; and these four, or any three of them, were empowered
to administer, at the pleasure of the king, "to all and singular liege
subjects of the realm," the following oath:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 30. Terms of the oath to the Statute of Succession.</div>

<p>"Ye shall swear to bear your faith, truth, and obedience only to the King's
Majesty, and to the heirs of his body, according to the limitation and
rehearsal within the statute of succession; and not to any other within

oath be made or hath been made by you to any other person or persons, that
then you do repute the same as vain and annihilate: and that to your

With this last resolution the House rose, having sat seventy-five days, and
despatched their business swiftly. A week later, the news arrived from Rome
that there too all was at length over; that the cause was decided, and
decided against the king. The history or the closing catastrophe is as

brought about is unfortunately incomplete in many important particulars.

<div class="sidenote">Mission of the Bishop of Paris to Rome.</div>

<p>On the receipt in Paris of the letter in which Henry threatened to organize
a Protestant confederacy, Du Bellay, in genuine anxiety for the welfare of
Christendom, had volunteered his services for a final effort. Not a moment
was to be lost, for the courts at Rome were already busy with the great
cause; but the king's evident reluctance to break with the Catholic powers
gave room for hope that something might still be done; and going in person
to England, the bishop had induced Henry, at the last extremity, either to
entrust him with representative powers, or else to allow him after all to
make some kind of concession. I am unable to learn the extent to which
Henry yielded, but that an offer was made of some kind is evident from the
form of the
story.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">At first, with appearance of success.</span>
The winter was very cold, but the bishop made his
way to Rome with the haste of good will, and arrived in time to stay
judgment, which was on the point of being pronounced. It seemed, for the
moment, as if he would succeed. He was permitted to make engagements on the

part of Henry; and that time might be allowed for communication with
England, the pope agreed to delay sentence till the 23d of March. The
bishop's terms were approved by the king, and a courier was sent off with
letters of confirmation; Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Revett following
leisurely, with a more ample commission. The stone which had been
laboriously rolled to the summit of the hill was trembling on the brink,
and in a moment might rebound into the plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The courier is delayed on the road. The conclave are divided; a
majority decide against the king, and sentence is pronounced.</div>

<p>But this was not to be the end. Some accidental cause delayed the courier;
the 23d of March came, and he had not arrived. Du Bellay implored a further
respite. The King of England, he said, had waited six years; it was not a
great thing for the papal council to wait six days. The cardinals were
divided; but the Spanish party were the strongest, and when the votes were
taken carried the day. The die was cast, and the pope, in spite of himself,
his promises, and his conscience, drove at length upon the rocks to which
he had been so long
drifting.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
In deference to the opinion of the
majority of the cardinals, he pronounced the original marriage to have been
valid, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
dispensation by which it was permitted to have been legal; and,
<span class="sidenote">Henry must either submit, or is excommunicated.</span>
as a natural consequence, Henry, King of England, should he fail in
obedience to this judgment, was declared to be excommunicate from the
fellowship of the church, and to have forfeited the allegiance of his
subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Imperialists engage that Charles shall enforce the
sentence.</div>

<p>Lest the censures should be discredited by a blank discharge, engagements
were entered into, that within four months of the promulgation of the
sentence, the emperor would invade England, and Henry should be
deposed.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The imperialists illuminated Rome; cannon were fired;

"the Empire and Spain."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Already, in their eager expectation, England
was a second Netherlands, a captured province under the regency of
Catherine or Mary.</p>

<p>Two days later, the courier arrived. The pope, at the entreaties of the
Bishop of Paris, reassembled the consistory, to consider whether the steps
which had been taken should be undone. They sat debating all night, and the
result was nothing. No dependence could be placed on the cardinals, Du
Bellay said, for they spoke one way, and voted another.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Thus all was over. In a scene of general helplessness the long drama
closed, and, what we call accident, for want of some better word, cut the
knot at last over which human incapacity had so vainly laboured. The Bishop
of Paris retired from Rome in despair. On his way back, he met the English
commissioners at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Bologna, and told them that their errand was hopeless,
<span class="sidenote">Du Bellay says that the pope was "coacted" by the Spanish party
against his judgment.</span>
and that they need not proceed. "When we asked him," wrote Sir Edward Karne
to the king, "the cause of such hasty process, he made answer that the
imperialists at Rome had strengthened themselves in such a manner, that
they coacted the said Bishop of Rome to give sentence contrary to his own
mind, and the expectation of himself and of the French king. He showed us
also that the Lady Princess Dowager sent lately, in the month of March
past, letters to the Bishop of Rome, and also to her proctors, whereby the
Bishop of Rome was much moved for her part. The imperials, before the
sentence was given, promised, in the emperor's behalf, that he would be the
executor of the sentence."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>This is all which we are able to say of the immediate catastrophe which
decided the fate of England, and through England, of the world. The deep
impenetrable falsehood of the Roman ecclesiastics prevents us from
discovering with what intentions the game of the last few weeks or months
had been played; it is sufficient for Englishmen to remember, that,
whatever may have been the explanation of his conduct, the pope, in the
concluding passage of his connexion with this country, furnished the most
signal justification which was ever given for the revolt from an abused
authority. The supreme judge in Christendom had for six years trifled with
justice, out of fear of an earthly prince; he concluded these years with
uniting the extreme of folly with the extreme of improbity, and pronounced
a sentence, willingly or unwillingly, which he had acknowledged to be
unjust.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Charity may possibly acquit Clement of conscious duplicity. He was one of
those men who waited upon fortune, and waited always without success; who
gave his word as the interest of the moment suggested, trusting that it
might be convenient to observe it; and who was too long accustomed to break
his promises to look with any particular alarm on that contingency. It is
possible, also,&mdash;for of this Clement was capable,&mdash;that he knew from the
beginning the conclusion to which he would at last be driven; that he had
engaged himself with Charles to decide in Catherine's favour as distinctly
as he had engaged himself with Francis to decide against her; and that all
his tortuous scheming was intended either to weary out the patience of the
King of England, or to entangle him in acknowledgments from which he would
not be able to extricate himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clement had formed a mistaken notion of the English temper,</div>

<p>He was mistaken, certainly, in the temper of the English nation; he
believed what the friars told him; and trusting to the promises of
disaffection, insurrection, invasion&mdash;those <i>ignes fatui</i> which for sixty
years floated so delusively before the Italian imagination, he imagined,
perhaps, that he might trifle with Henry with impunity. This only is
impossible, that, if he had seriously intended to fulfil the promises which
he had made to the French king, the accidental delay of a courier could
<span class="sidenote">But his true intentions are inscrutable.</span>
have made so large a difference in his determination. It is not possible
that, if he had assured himself, as he pretended, that justice was on the
side against which he had declared, he would not have availed himself of
any pretext to retreat from a position which ought to have been intolerable
to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Francis warns Henry to prepare for danger.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
The question, however, had ended, "as all things in this world do have
their end." The news of the sentence arrived in England at the beginning of
April, with an intimation of the engagements which had been entered upon by
the imperial ambassador for an invasion. Du Bellay returned to Paris at the
same time, to report the failure of his undertaking; and Francis,
disappointed, angry, and alarmed, sent the Duke of Guise to London with
promises of support if an attempt to invade was really made, and with a
<span class="sidenote">Preparation in Flanders for an invasion of England.</span>
warning at the same time to Henry to prepare for danger. Troops were
gathering in Flanders; detachments were on their way out of Italy, Germany,
and Bohemia, to be followed by three thousand Spaniards, and perhaps many
more; and the object avowed for these preparations was wholly
incommensurate with their magnitude.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> For his own sake, Francis could
not permit a successful invasion of England, unless, indeed, he himself was
to take part in it; and therefore, with entire sincerity, he offered his
services. The cordial understanding for which Henry had hoped was at an
end; but the political confederacy remained, which the interests of the two
countries combined for the present to preserve unbroken.</p>

<p>Guise proposed another interview at Calais between the sovereigns. The king
for the moment was afraid to leave
England,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
lest the opportunity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
should be made use of for an insurrection; but prudence taught him, though
disappointed in Francis, to make the best of a connexion too convenient to
be sacrificed. The German league was left in abeyance till the immediate
danger was passed, and till the effect of the shock in England itself had
been first experienced. He gladly accepted, in lieu of it, an offer that
the French fleet should guard the Channel through the summer; and
meanwhile, he collected himself resolutely to abide the issue, whatever the
issue was to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the sentence upon Henry.</div>

<p>The Tudor spirit was at length awake in the English sovereign. He had
exhausted the resources of patience; he had stooped even to indignity to
avoid the conclusion which had come at last. There was nothing left but to
meet defiance by defiance, and accept the position to which the pope had
driven him. In quiet times occasionally wayward and capricious, Henry, like
Elizabeth after him, reserved his noblest nature for the moments of danger,
and was ever greatest when peril was most immediate. Woe to those who
crossed him now, for the time was grown stern, and to trifle further was to
<span class="sidenote">April 7. Convocation declares the pope's authority abolished.</span>
be lost. The suspended act of parliament was made law on the day (it would
seem) of the arrival of the sentence. Convocation, which was still sitting,
hurried through a declaration that the pope had no more power in England
than any other bishop.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Five years before, if a heretic had ventured so

shut their ears and run upon
him: now they only contended with each other in precipitate obsequiousness.
The houses of the Observants at Canterbury and Greenwich, which had been
implicated with the Nun of Kent, were suppressed, and the brethren were
scattered among monasteries where they could be under surveillance. The Nun
and her friends were sent to

The ordnance stores were
examined, the repairs of the navy were hastened, and the garrisons were
strengthened along the coast. Everywhere the realm armed itself for the
struggle, looking well to the joints of its harness and to the temper of
its weapons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The commission sits to receive the oaths of allegiance.</div>

<p>The commission appointed under the Statute of Succession opened its
sittings to receive the oaths of allegiance. Now, more than ever, was it
necessary to try men's dispositions, when the pope had challenged their
obedience. In words all went well: the peers swore; bishops, abbots,
priors, heads of colleges, swore<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> with scarcely an exception,&mdash;the
nation seemed to unite in an unanimous declaration of freedom. In one
quarter only, and that a very painful one, was there refusal. It was found
solely among the persons who had been implicated in the late conspiracy.
Neither Sir Thomas More nor the Bishop of Rochester could expect that their
recent conduct would exempt them from an obligation which the people
generally accepted with good will. They had connected themselves, perhaps
unintentionally, with a body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> of confessed traitors. An opportunity was
offered them of giving evidence of their loyalty, and escaping from the
shadow of distrust. More had been treated leniently; Fisher had been
treated far more than leniently. It was both fair and natural that they
should be called upon to give proof that their lesson had not been learnt
in vain; and, in fact, no other persons, if they had been passed over,
could have been called upon to swear, for no other persons had laid
themselves open to so just suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas More is required to swear.</div>

<p>Their conduct so exactly tallied, that they must have agreed beforehand on
the course which they would adopt; and in following the details, we need
concern ourselves only with the nobler figure.</p>

<p>The commissioners sate at the archbishop's palace at Lambeth; and at the
end of April, Sir Thomas More received a summons to appear before
them.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
He was at his house at Chelsea, where for the last two years he
<span class="sidenote">He confesses at Chelsea church,</span>
had lived in deep retirement, making ready for evil times. Those times at
length were come. On the morning on which he was to present himself, he
confessed and received the sacrament in Chelsea church; and "whereas," says
his great-grandson, "at other times, before he parted from his wife and
children, they used to bring him to his boat, and he there kissing them
bade them farewell, at this time he suffered none of them to follow him
forth of his gate, but pulled the wicket after him, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a heavy heart he took boat with his son
<span class="sidenote">April 25. And goes by boat to Lambeth.</span>
Roper."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
He was leaving his home for the last
time, and he knew it. He sat silent for some minutes, then, with a sudden
start, said, "I thank our Lord, the field is won." Lambeth Palace was
crowded with people who had come on the same errand with himself. More was
called in early, and found Cromwell present with the four commissioners,
<span class="sidenote">The oath is read to him, and he refuses it.</span>
and also the Abbot of Westminster. The oath was read to him. It implied
that he should keep the statute of succession in all its parts, and he
desired to see the statute itself. He read it through, and at once replied
that others might do as they pleased; he would blame no one for taking the
oath; but for himself it was impossible. He would swear willingly to the
part of it which secured the succession to the children of Queen
Anne.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
That was a matter on which parliament was competent to decide, and he had
no right to make objections. If he might be allowed to take an oath to this
portion of the statute in language of his own, he would do it; but as the
words stood, he would "peril his soul" by using them. The Lord Chancellor
<span class="sidenote">He is desired to retire and reconsider his answer. Fisher
follows his example, and refuses also. More again refuses.</span>
desired him to reconsider his answer. He retired to the garden, and in his
absence others were called in; them the Bishop of Rochester, who refused in
the same terms. More was then recalled. He was asked if he persisted in his
resolution; and when he replied that he did, he was requested to state his
reasons. He said that he was afraid of increasing the king's displeasure,
but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
he could be assured that he might explain himself safely, he was
ready to do so. If his objection could then be answered to his
satisfaction, he would swear; in the meantime, he repeated, very
explicitly, that he judged no one&mdash;he spoke only for himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cranmer tries to contrive an escape for him,</div>

<p>An opening seemed to be offered in these expressions which was caught at by
Cranmer's kindhearted casuistry. If Sir Thomas More could not condemn
others for taking the oath, the archbishop said, Sir Thomas More could not
be sure that it was sin to take it; while his duty to his king and to the
parliament was open and unquestioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But in vain.</div>

<p>More hesitated for an instant, but he speedily recovered his firmness. He
had considered what he ought to do, he said; his conscience was clear about
it, and he could say no more than he had said already. They continued to
argue with him, but without effect; he had made up his mind; the victory,
as he said, had been won.</p>

<p>Cromwell was deeply affected. In his passionate regret, he exclaimed, that
he had rather his only son had lost his head than that More should have
refused the oath. No one knew better than Cromwell that intercession would
be of no further use; that he could not himself advise the king to give
way. The parliament, after grave consideration, had passed a law which they
held necessary to secure the peace of the country; and two persons of high
rank refused obedience to it, whose example would tell in every English
household. Either, therefore, the act was not worth the parchment on which
it was written, or the penalties of it must be enforced: no middle way, no
compromise, no acquiescent reservations, could in such a case be admitted.
The law must have its way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More, with Fisher, is committed to the keeping of the Abbot of
Westminster.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The recusants were committed for four days to the keeping of the Abbot of
Westminster; and the council met to determine on the course to be pursued.
Their offence, by the act, was misprision of treason. On the other hand,
they had both offered to acknowledge the Princess Elizabeth as the lawful
heir to the throne; and the question was raised whether this offer should
be accepted. It was equivalent to a demand that the form should be altered,
not for them only, but for every man. If persons of their rank and
<span class="sidenote">Debate in the Council</span>
notoriety were permitted to swear with a qualification, the same privilege
must be conceded to all. But there was so much anxiety to avoid
extremities, and so warm a regard was personally felt for Sir Thomas More,
that this objection was not allowed to be fatal. It was thought that
possibly an exception might be made, yet kept a secret from the world; and
the fact that they had sworn under any form might go far to silence
objectors and reconcile the better class of the
disaffected.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> This view
<span class="sidenote">Cranmer urges that they may take the oath in a modified form.</span>
was particularly urged by Cranmer, always gentle, hoping, and
illogical.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
But, in fact, secresy was impossible. If More's discretion
could have been relied upon, Fisher's babbling tongue would have trumpeted
his victory to all the winds. Nor would the government consent to pass
censure on its own conduct by evading the question whether the act was or
was not <i>just</i>. If it was not just, it ought not to be maintained at all,
if it was just, there must be no respect of persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The government cannot yield.</div>

<p>The clauses to which the bishop and the ex-chancellor declined to bind
themselves were those which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> declared illegal the marriage of the king with
Catherine, and the marriage legal between the king and Queen Anne. To
refuse these was to declare Mary legitimate, to declare Elizabeth
illegitimate, and would do more to strengthen Mary's claims than could be
undone by a thousand oaths. However large might be More's estimate of the
power of parliament, he could have given no clear answer&mdash;and far less
could Fisher have given a clear answer&mdash;if they had been required to say
the part which they would take, should the emperor invade the kingdom under
the pope's sanction. The emperor would come to execute a sentence which in
their consciences they believed to be just; how could they retain their
allegiance to Henry, when their convictions must be with the invading army?</p>

<p>What ought to have been done let those say who disapprove of what was
actually done. The high character of the prisoners, while it increased the
desire, increased the difficulty of sparing them; and to have given way
would have been a confession of a doubtful cause, which at such a time
<span class="sidenote">Cromwell explains to Cranmer that concession is
impossible.</span>
would not have been dangerous, but would have been fatal. Anne Boleyn is
said to have urged the king to remain peremptory;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> but the following
letter of Cromwell's explains the ultimate resolution of the council in a
very reasonable manner. It was written to Cranmer, in reply to his
arguments for concession.</p>

<p>"My Lord, after mine humble commendation, it may please your Grace to be
advertised that I have received your letter, and showed the same to the
King's Highness; who, perceiving that your mind and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
opinion is, that it
were good that the Bishop of Rochester and Master More should be sworn to
the act of the king's succession, and not to the preamble of the same,
thinketh that if their oaths should be taken, it were an occasion to all
men to refuse the whole, or at least the like. For, in case they be sworn
to the succession, and not to the preamble, it is to be thought that it
might be taken not only as a confirmation of the Bishop of Rome's
authority, but also as a reprobation of the king's second marriage.
Wherefore, to the intent that no such things should be brought into the
heads of the people, by the example of the said Bishop of Rochester and
<span class="sidenote">And begs that he will not urge it further.</span>
Master More, the King's Highness in no wise willeth but that they shall be
sworn as well to the preamble as to the act. Wherefore his Grace specially
trusteth that ye will in no wise attempt to move him to the contrary; for
as his Grace supposeth, that manner of swearing, if it shall be suffered,
may be an utter destruction to his whole cause, and also to the effect of
the law made for the same."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Thus, therefore, with much regret the council decided&mdash;and, in fact, why
should they have decided otherwise? They were satisfied that they were
right in requiring the oath; and their duty to the English nation obliged
them to persevere. They must go their way; and those who thought them wrong
must go theirs; and the great God would judge between them. It was a hard
thing to suffer for an opinion; but there are times when opinions are as
dangerous as acts; and liberty of conscience was a plea which could be
urged with a bad grace for men who, while in power, had fed the stake with
heretics. They were summoned for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">They are examined a last time, and again refusing, are sent to

a last time, to return the same answer as
they had returned before; and nothing remained but to pronounce against
them the penalties of the statute, imprisonment at the king's pleasure, and
forfeiture. The latter part of the sentence was not enforced. More's family
were left in the enjoyment of his property. Fisher's bishoprick was not
taken from him. They were sent to the Tower, where for the present we leave
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Directions to the clergy to explain in their churches the
changes which had taken place.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in accordance with the resolution taken in council on the 2d of
December,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> but which seems to have been suspended till the issue of the
trial at Rome was decided, the bishops, who had been examined severally on
the nature of the papal authority, and whose answers had been embodied in
the last act of parliament, were now required to instruct the clergy
throughout their dioceses&mdash;and the clergy in turn to instruct the
people&mdash;in the nature of the changes which had taken place. A bishop was to
preach each Sunday at Paul's Cross, on the pope's usurpation. Every secular
priest was directed to preach on the same subject week after week, in his
<span class="sidenote">Noblemen and gentlemen to teach their servants.</span>
parish church. Abbots and priors were to teach their convents; noblemen and
gentlemen their families and servants; mayors and aldermen the boroughs. In
town and in all houses, at all dinner-tables, the conduct of the pope and
the causes of the separation from Rome were to be the one subject of
conversation; that the whole nation might be informed accurately and
faithfully of the grounds on which the government had acted. No wiser
method could have been adopted. The imperial agents would be busy under the

insurrection. The machinery of order was set in force to counteract the
machinery of sedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishops sworn to the king as Head of the Church, and the pope's
name blotted out of the Mass books.</div>

<p>Further, every bishop, in addition to the oath of allegiance, had sworn
obedience to the king as Supreme Head of the Church;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and this was the
title under which he was to be spoken of in all churches of the realm. A
royal order had been issued, "that all manner of prayers, rubrics, canons
of Mass books, and all other books in the churches wherein the Bishop of
Rome was named, or his presumptuous and proud pomp and authority preferred,
should utterly be abolished, eradicated, and rased out, and his name and
memory should be never more, except to his contumely and reproach,
remembered; but perpetually be suppressed and obscured."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Nor were these mere idle sounds, like the bellow of unshotted cannon; but
words with a sharp, prompt meaning, which the king intended to be obeyed.
He had addressed his orders to the clergy, because the clergy were the
officials who had possession of the pulpits from which the people were to
be taught; but he knew their nature too well to trust them. They were too
well schooled in the tricks of reservation; and, for the nonce, it was
necessary to reverse the posture of the priest and of his flock, and to set
the honest laymen to overlook their pastors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 9. Circular order addressed to the sheriffs to see that the
clergy do their duty.</div>

<p>With the instructions to the bishops circulars went round to the sheriffs
of the counties, containing a full account of these instructions, and an
appeal to their loyalty to see that the royal orders were obeyed. "We," the
king wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to them, "seeing, esteeming, and reputing you to be of such
singular and vehement zeal and affection towards the glory of Almighty God,
and of so faithful, loving, and obedient heart towards us, as you will
accomplish, with all power, diligence, and labour, whatsoever shall be to
the preferment and setting forth of God's word, have thought good, not only
to signify unto you by these our letters, the particulars of the charge
given by us to the bishops, but also to require and straitly charge you,
upon pain of your allegiance, and as ye shall avoid our high indignation
and displeasure, [that] at your uttermost peril, laying aside all vain
affections, respects, and other carnal considerations, and setting only
before your eyes the mirrour of the truth, the glory of God, the dignity of
your Sovereign Lord and King, and the great concord and unity, and
inestimable profit and utility, that shall by the due execution of the
premises ensue to yourselves and to all other faithful and loving subjects,

bishops do truly and sincerely, without all manner of cloke, colour, or
<span class="sidenote">If they hear of any slackness, they are to report to the
Council,</span>

aforesaid. And in case ye shall hear that the said bishops, or any other
ecclesiastical person, do omit and leave undone any part or parcel of the
premises, or else in the execution and setting forth of the same, do coldly
and feignedly use any manner of sinister addition, wrong interpretation, or
painted colour, then we straitly charge and command you that you do make,
undelayedly, and with all speed and diligence, declaration and

<p>So Henry spoke at last. There was no place any more for nice distinctions
and care of tender consciences. The general, when the shot is flying,
cannot qualify his orders with dainty periods. Swift command and swift
obedience can alone be tolerated; and martial law for those who hesitate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Clement VII.</div>

<p>This chapter has brought many things to a close. Before ending it we will
leap over three months, to the termination of the career of the pope who
has been so far our companion. Not any more was the distracted Clement to
twist his handkerchief, or weep, or flatter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> or wildly wave his arms in
angry impotence, he was to lie down in his long rest, and vex the world no
more. He had lived to set England free&mdash;an exploit which, in the face of so
persevering an anxiety to escape a separation, required a rare genius and a
combination of singular qualities. He had finished his work, and now he was
allowed to depart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His character.</div>

<p>In him, infinite insincerity was accompanied with a grace of manner which
regained confidence as rapidly as it was forfeited. Desiring sincerely, so
far as he could be sincere in anything, to please every one by turns, and
reckless of truth to a degree in which he was without a rival in the world,
he sought only to escape his difficulties by inactivity, and he trusted to
provide himself with a refuge against all contingencies by waiting upon
time. Even when at length he was compelled to act, and to act in a distinct
direction, his plausibility long enabled him to explain away his conduct;
and, honest in the excess of his dishonesty, he wore his falsehood with so
easy a grace that it assumed the character of truth. He was false,
deceitful, treacherous; yet he had the virtue of not pretending to be
virtuous. He was a real man, though but an indifferent one; and we can
refuse to no one, however grave his faults, a certain ambiguous sympathy,
when in his perplexities he shows us features so truly human in their
weakness as those of Clement VII.</p>

"At her setting forward to ride at hunting, her Grace asked me if I had
heard of late any tidings out of England. I told her Grace, as it is true,
that I had none. She gave me a look as that she should marvel thereof, and
said to me, 'Jay des nouvelles qui ne me semblent point trop bonnes,' and
told me touching the King's Highness's marriage. To the which I answered
her Grace and said, 'Madame, je ne me doute point syl est faict, et quand
le veult prendre et entendre de bonne part et au sain chemyn, sans porter
faveur parentelle que ung le trouvera tout lente et bien raysonnable par
layde de Dieu et de bonne conscience.' Her Grace said to me again,

she continued,
</p><p>
"And as our Lord in his mercy has worked so great a good for Christendom by
your Highness's hands, so has he enlightened also his Holiness; and I and
all this realm have now a sure hope that, with the grace of God, his
Holiness will slay this second Turk, this affair between the King my Lord
and me. Second Turk, I call it, from the misfortunes which, through his
Holiness's long delay, have grown out of it, and are now so vast and of so
ill example that I know not whether this or the Turk be the worst. Sorry am
I to have been compelled to importune your Majesty so often in this matter,
for sure I am you do not need my pressing. But I see delay to be so
calamitous, my own life is so unquiet and so painful, and the opportunity
to make an end now so convenient, that it seems as if God of his goodness
had brought his Holiness and your Majesty together to bring about so great
a good. I am forced to be importunate, and I implore your Highness for the
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, that in return for the signal benefits
which God each day is heaping on you, you will accomplish for me this great
blessing, and bring his Holiness to a decision. Let him remember what he
promised you at Bologna. The truth here is known, and he will thus destroy
the hopes of those who persuade the King my Lord that he will never pass
judgment."&mdash;Queen Catherine to Charles V.: <i>MS. Simancas</i>, November 15,

respect to the election of bishops explain the unreality of the new
arrangement, and divest it of the character of wanton tyranny with which it
appeared <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> to press upon the Chapters. The history of this
statute is curious, and perhaps explains the intentions with which it was
originally passed. It was repealed by the 2d of the 1st of Edward VI. on
the ground that the liberty of election was merely nominal, and that the
Chapters ought to be relieved of responsibility when they had no power of
choice. Direct nomination by the crown was substituted for the <i>cong&eacute;
d'&eacute;lire</i>, and remained the practice till the reaction under Mary, when the
indefinite system was resumed which had existed before the Reformation. On
the accession of Elizabeth, the statute of 25 Henry VIII. was again
enacted. The more complicated process of Henry was preferred to the more
simple one of Edward, and we are naturally led to ask the reason of so
singular a preference. I cannot but think that it was this. The Council of
Regency under Edward VI. treated the Church as an institution of the State,
while Henry and Elizabeth endeavoured (under difficulties) to regard it
under its more Catholic aspect of an organic body. So long as the
Reformation was in progress, it was necessary to prevent the intrusion upon
the bench of bishops of Romanizing tendencies, and the deans and chapters
were therefore protected by a strong hand from their own possible mistakes.
But the form of liberty was conceded to them, not, I hope, to place
deliberately a body of clergymen in a degrading position, but in the belief
that at no distant time the Church might be allowed without danger to
resume some degree of self-government.</p></div>

anywhere find traces of it. It is not to be confounded with the act against

separately mentioned. It received the royal assent on the 30th of March,
while that against Peter's Pence was suspended till the 7th of April. It
contained, also, an indirect assertion that the king was Head of the
English Church, according to the title which had been given him by
Convocation. (King's Proclamation: Foxe, Vol. V. p. 69.) For some cause or

"<span class="smcap">The</span> Pander<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
sheweth, in the first chapter of his book, called <i>Salus
Populi</i>, that the holy woman, Brigitta, used to inquire of her good angel
many questions of secrets divine; and among all other she inquired, 'Of
<span class="sidenote">The vision of the Holy Brigitta.</span>
what Christian land was most souls damned?' The angel shewed her a land in
the west part of the world. She inquired the cause why? The angel said, for
there is most continual war, root of hate and envy, and of vices contrary
to charity; and without charity the souls cannot be saved. And the angel
did shew to her the lapse of the souls of Christian folk of that land, how
they fell down into hell, as thick as any hail showers. And pity thereof
moved the Pander to conceive his said book, as in the said chapter plainly
doth appear; for after his opinion, this [Ireland] is the land that the
angel understood; for there is no land in this world of so continual war
within itself; ne of so great shedding of Christian blood; ne of so great
robbing, spoiling, preying, and burning; ne of so great wrongful extortion
continually, as Ireland. Wherefore it cannot be denied by very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
estimation of man but that the angel did understand the land of
Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Nine hundred years had passed away since the vision of the Holy Brigitta,
and four hundred since the custody of the unfortunate country had been
undertaken by the most orderly nation in the world; yet, at the close of
all those centuries, "it could not be denied by very estimation of man"
that poor Irish souls were still descending, thick as hail showers, into
the general abyss of worthlessness. The Pander's satire upon the English
enterprise was a heavy one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapid success of the first invasion of Ireland.</div>

<p>When the wave of the Norman invasion first rolled across St. George's
Channel, the success was as easy and appeared as complete as William's
conquest of the Saxons. There was no unity of purpose among the Irish
chieftains, no national spirit which could support a sustained resistance.
The country was open and undefended,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
and after a few feeble struggles
<span class="sidenote">The character of the country.</span>
the contest ceased. Ireland is a basin, the centre a fertile undulating
plain, the edges a fringe of mountains that form an almost unbroken coast
line. Into these highlands the Irish tribes were driven, where they were
allowed to retain a partial independence, under condition of paying
tribute; the Norman immigrants dividing among themselves the inheritance of
the dispossessed inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
<span class="sidenote">The settlement of it under the Norman leaders.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Strongbow and his companions became the
feudal sovereigns of the island, holding their estates under the English
crown. The common law of England was introduced; the king's writ passed
current from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear;<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and if the leading
Norman families had remained on the estates which they had conquered, or if
those who did remain had retained the character which they brought with
them, the entire country would, in all likelihood, have settled down
obediently, and at length willingly, under a rule which it would have been
without power to resist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two causes of the decline of their authority.</div>

<p>An expectation so natural was defeated by two causes, alike unforeseen and
perplexing. The Northern nations, when they overran the Roman Empire, were
in search of homes; and they subdued only to colonize. The feudal system
bound the noble to the lands which he possessed; and a theory of ownership
of estates, as consisting merely in the receipt of rents from other
occupants, was alike unheard of in fact, and repugnant to the principles of
feudal society. To Ireland belongs, among its other misfortunes, the credit
of having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Absenteeism.</span>
first given birth to absentees. The descendants of the first
invaders preferred to regard their inheritance, not as a theatre of duty on
which they were to reside, but as a possession which they might farm for
their individual advantage. They managed their properties by agents, as
sources of revenue, leasing them even among the Irish themselves; and the
tenantry, deprived of the supporting presence of their lords, and governed
only in a merely mercenary spirit, transferred back their allegiance to the
exiled chiefs of the old race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> This was one grave cause of the
English failure, but serious as it was, it would not have sufficed alone to
explain the full extent of the evil. Some most powerful families rooted
themselves in the soil, and never forsook it; the Geraldines, of Munster
and Kildare; the Butlers, of Kilkenny; the De Burghs, the Birminghams, the
De Courcies, and many others. If these had been united among themselves, or
had retained their allegiance to England, their influence could not have
been long opposed successfully. Their several principalities would have
formed separate centres of civilization; and the strong system of order
would have absorbed and superseded the most obstinate resistance which
could have been offered by the scattered anarchy of the Celts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The assimilation of the Norman Irish to the native Celts.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, the materials of good were converted into the worst
instruments of evil. If an objection had been raised to the colonization of
America, or to the conquest of India, on the ground that the character of
Englishmen would be too weak to contend successfully against that of the
races with whom they would be brought into contact, and that they would
relapse into barbarism, such an alarm would have seemed too preposterous to
be entertained; yet, prior to experience, it would have been equally
reasonable to expect that the modern Englishman would adopt the habits of
the Hindoo or the Mohican, as that the fiery knights of Normandy would have
stooped to imitate a race whom they despised as slaves; that they would
have flung away their very knightly names to assume a barbarous
equivalent;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
and would so utterly have cast aside the commanding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
features of their Northern extraction, that their children's children could
be distinguished neither in soul nor body, neither in look, in dress, in
language, nor in disposition, from the Celts whom they had subdued. Such,
<span class="sidenote">Efforts of the government to repress the growing evil.</span>
however, was the extraordinary fact. The Irish who had been conquered in
the field revenged their defeat on the minds and hearts of their
conquerors; and in yielding, yielded only to fling over their new masters
the subtle spell of the Celtic disposition. In vain the government
attempted to stem the evil. Statute was passed after statute forbidding the
"Englishry" of Ireland to use the Irish language, or intermarry with Irish
families, or copy Irish habits.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
Penalties were multiplied on
penalties; fines, forfeitures, and at last death itself, were threatened
for such offences. But all in vain. The stealthy evil crept on
<span class="sidenote">Fresh colonists from England follow in the same course.</span>
irresistibly.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Fresh colonists were sent over to restore the system,
but only for themselves or their children to be swept into the stream; and
from the century which succeeded the Conquest till the reign of the eighth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Henry, the strange phenomenon repeated itself, generation after generation,
baffling the wisdom of statesmen, and paralysing every effort at a remedy.</p>

<p>Here was a difficulty which no skill could contend against, and which was
increased by the exertions which were made to oppose it. The healthy
elements which were introduced to leaven the old became themselves
infected, and swelled the mass of evil; and the clearest observers were
those who were most disposed to despair. Popery has been the scapegoat
which, for the last three centuries, has borne the reproach of Ireland; but
before popery had ceased to be the faith of the world, the problem had long
<span class="sidenote">Despair of English statesmen.</span>
presented itself in all its hopelessness. "Some say" (this is the language
of 1515), "and for the most part every man, that to find the antidotum for
this disease is impossible&mdash;for what remedy can be had now more than hath
been had unto this time? And there was never remedy found in this two
hundred year that could prosper; and no medicine can be had now for this
infirmity but such as hath been had afore this time. And folk were as wise
that time as they be now; and since they could never find remedy, how
<span class="sidenote">The herbs did never grow which could cure the evils of Ireland.</span>
should remedy be found by us? And the Pander maketh answer and saith, that
it is no marvel that our fathers that were of more wit and wisdom than we,
could not find remedy in the premises, <i>for the herbs did never grow</i>. And
also he saith that the wealth and prosperity of every land is the
commonwealth of the same, and not the private wealth; and all the English
noble folk of this land passeth always their private weal; and in regard
thereof setteth little or nought by the common weal; insomuch as there is
no common folk in all this world so little set by, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
greatly despised, so
feeble, so poor, so greatly trodden under foot, as the king's poor common
folk be of Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
There was no true care for the common weal&mdash;that
<span class="sidenote">Causes of the corruption.</span>
was the especial peculiarity by which the higher classes in Ireland were
unfortunately distinguished. In England, the last consideration of a
noble-minded man was his personal advantage; Ireland was a theatre for a
universal scramble of selfishness, and the invaders caught the national
contagion, and became, as the phrase went, <i>ipsis Hibernis Hiberniores</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The outward circumstances of the chiefs.</div>

<p>The explanation of this disastrous phenomenon lay partly in the
circumstances in which they were placed, partly in the inherent tendencies
of human nature itself. The Norman nobles entered Ireland as independent
adventurers, who, each for himself, carved out his fortune with his sword;
and, unsupported as they were from home, or supported only at precarious
intervals, divided from one another by large tracts of country, and
surrounded by Irish dependents, it was doubtless more convenient for them
to govern by humouring the habits and traditions to which their vassals
<span class="sidenote">Inability of the English princes to maintain a
standing army.</span>
would most readily submit. The English government, occupied with Scotland
and France, had no leisure to maintain a powerful central authority; and a
central disciplinarian rule enforced by the sword was contrary to the
genius of the age. Under the feudal system, the kings governed only by the
consent and with the support of the nobility; and the maintenance at Dublin
of a standing military force would have been regarded with extreme
suspicion in England, as well as in Ireland. Hence the affairs of both
countries were,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
for the most part, administered under the same forms,
forms which were as ill suited to the waywardness of the Celt, as they met
exactly the stronger nature of the Saxon. At intervals, when the government
was exasperated by unusual outrages, some prince of the blood was sent
across as viceroy; and half a century of acquiescence in disorder would be
<span class="sidenote">Spasmodic character of their administration.</span>
followed by a spasmodic severity, which irritated without subduing, and
forfeited affection, while it failed to terrify. At all other times,
Ireland was governed by the Norman Irish, and these, as the years went on,
were tempted by their convenience to strengthen themselves by Irish
alliances, to identify their interests with those of the native chiefs, in
order to conciliate their support; to prefer the position of wild and
independent sovereigns, resting on the attachment of a people whose
affections they had gained by learning to resemble them, to that of
military lords over a hostile population, the representatives of a distant
authority, on which they could not rely.</p>

<p>This is a partial account of the Irish difficulty. We must look deeper,
however, for the full interpretation of it; and outward circumstances never
alone suffice to explain a moral transformation. The Roman military
colonists remained Roman alike on the Rhine and on the Euphrates. The
Turkish conquerors caught no infection from Greece, or from the provinces
on the Danube. The Celts in England were absorbed by the Saxon invaders;
and the Mogul and the Anglo-Indian alike have shown no tendency to
assimilate with the Hindoo. When a marked type of human character yields
before another, the change is owing to some element of power in that other,
which coming in contact with elements weaker than itself, subdues and
absorbs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Peculiar feature of the Irish temper.</span>
them. The Irish spirit, which exercised so fatal a fascination,
was enabled to triumph over the Norman in virtue of representing certain
perennial tendencies of humanity, which are latent in all mankind, and
which opportunity may at any moment develope. It was not a national
spirit&mdash;the clans were never united, except by some common hatred; and the
normal relation of the chiefs towards each other was a relation of chronic
war and hostility. It was rather an impatience of control, a deliberate
preference for disorder, a determination in each individual man to go his
own way, whether it was a good way or a bad, and a reckless hatred of
industry. The result was the inevitable one&mdash;oppression, misery, and wrong.
<span class="sidenote">It possesses the counterfeit of every virtue.</span>
But in detail faults and graces were so interwoven, that the offensiveness
of the evil was disguised by the charm of the good; and even the Irish
vices were the counterfeit of virtues, contrived so cunningly that it was
hard to distinguish their true texture. The fidelity of the clansmen to
their leaders was faultlessly beautiful; extravagance appeared like
generosity, and improvidence like unselfishness; anarchy disguised itself
under the name of liberty; and war and plunder were decorated by poetry as
<span class="sidenote">Their peculiar charm.</span>
the honourable occupation of heroic natures. Such were the Irish with whom
the Norman conquerors found themselves in contact; and over them all was
thrown a peculiar imaginative grace, a careless atmosphere of humour,
sometimes gay, sometimes melancholy, always attractive, which at once
disarmed the hand which was raised to strike or punish them. These spirits
were dangerous neighbours. Men who first entered the country at mature age
might be fortified by experience against their influence, but on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the young<span class="sidenote">The foster-nurses and the minstrels.</span>
they must have exerted a charm of fatal potency. The foster-nurse first
chanted the spell over the cradle in wild passionate
melodies.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> It was
breathed in the ears of the growing boy by the minstrels who haunted the
halls,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
and the lawless attractions of disorder proved too strong for
the manhood which was trained among so perilous associations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A military despotism the only government which could have
succeeded.</div>

<p>For such a country, therefore, but one form of government could succeed&mdash;an
efficient military despotism. The people could be wholesomely controlled
only by an English deputy, sustained by an English army, and armed with
arbitrary power, till the inveterate turbulence of their tempers had died
away under repression, and they had learnt in their improved condition the
value of order and rule. This was the opinion of all statesmen who
possessed any real knowledge of Ireland, from Lord Talbot under Henry VI.
to the latest viceroy who attempted a milder method and found it fail. "If

which ought to be followed, it had been too inconvenient to pursue that
course. They had put off the evil day, preferring to close their eyes
against the mischief instead of grappling with it resolutely; and thus, at
the opening of the sixteenth century, when the hitherto neglected
barbarians were about to become a sword in the pope's hands to fight the
battle against the Reformation, the "king's Irish enemies" had recovered
all but absolute possession of the island, and nothing remained of
Strongbow's conquests save the shadow of a titular sovereignty, and a
country strengthened in hostility by the means which had been used to
subdue it.</p>

sketch of the position of the various chiefs, as they were at this time
scattered over the island. The English pale, originally comprising "the
four shires," as they were called, of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, and Uriel, or
Louth, had been shorn down to half its old dimensions. The line extended
from Dundalk to Ardee; from Ardee by Castletown to Kells; thence through
Athboy and Trim to the Castle of Maynooth; from Maynooth it crossed to
Claine upon the Liffey, and then followed up the line of the river to
Ballimore Eustace, from which place it skirted back at the rear of the
Wicklow and Dublin mountains to the forts at Dalkey, seven miles south of
Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> This narrow strip alone, some fifty miles long and twenty
broad, was in any sense English. Beyond the borders the common law of
England was of no authority; the king's writ was but a strip of parchment;
and the country was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> parcelled among a multitude of independent chiefs, who
acknowledged no sovereignty but that of strength, who levied tribute on the
inhabitants of the pale as a reward for a nominal protection of their
rights, and as a compensation for abstaining from the plunder of their
farms.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Their swords were their sceptres; their codes of right, the

<div class="sidenote">Ireland beyond the pale absolutely governed by the Irish chiefs.
Their distribution.</div>

<p>These chiefs, with their dependent clans, were distributed over the four
provinces in the following order. The Geraldines, the most powerful of the
remaining Normans, were divided into two branches. The Geraldines of the
south, under the Earls of Desmond, held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> Limerick, Cork, and Kerry; the
Geraldines of Leinster lay along the frontiers of the English pale; and the
heads of the house, the Earls of Kildare, were the feudal superiors of the
greater portion of the English counties. To the Butlers, Earls of Ormond
and Ossory, belonged Kilkenny, Carlow, and Tipperary. The De Burghs, or
Bourkes, as they called themselves, were scattered over Galway, Roscommon,
and the south of Sligo, occupying the broad plains which lie between the
Shannon and the mountains of Connemara and Mayo. This was the relative
position into which these clans had settled at the Conquest, and it had
been maintained with little variation.</p>

<p>The north, which had fallen to the Lacies and the De Courcies, had been
wholly recovered by the Irish. The Lacies had become extinct. The De
Courcies, once Earls of Ulster, had migrated to the south, and were reduced
to the petty fief of Kinsale, which they held under the Desmonds. The
Celtic chieftains had returned from the mountains to which they had been
driven, bringing back with them, more intensely than ever, the Irish habits
and traditions. Old men, who were alive in 1533, remembered a time when the
Norman families attempted to live in something of an English
manner,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
and when there were towns in the middle of Ireland with decent municipal
institutions. The wars of the Roses had destroyed the remnants of English
influence by calling away a number of leading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Recovery of the indigenous Irish.</span>
nobles, such especially as
were least infected by the Irish character; and the native chiefs had
reoccupied the lands of their ancestors, unresisted, if not welcomed as
allies. The O'Neils and O'Donnells had spread down over Ulster to the
frontiers of the pale. The O'Connors and O'Carrolls had recrossed the
Shannon, and pushed forwards into Kildare; the O'Connor Don was established
in a castle near Portarlington, said to be one of the strongest in Ireland;
and the O'Carrolls had seized Leap, an ancient Danish fortress, surrounded
by bog and forest, a few miles from Parsonstown. O'Brien of Inchiquin,
Prince&mdash;as he styled himself&mdash;of Thomond, no longer contented with his
principality of Clare, had thrown a bridge across the Shannon five miles
above Limerick, and was thus enabled to enter Munster at his pleasure and
spread his authority towards the south; while the M'Carties and
O'Sullivans, in Cork and Kerry, were only not dangerous to the Earls of
Desmond, because the Desmonds were more Irish than themselves, and were
accepted as their natural chiefs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earls of Ormond only continue to hold them in check.</div>

<p>In Tipperary and Kilkenny only the Celtic reaction was held in check. The
Earls of Ormond, although they were obliged themselves to live as Irish
chieftains, and to govern by the Irish law, yet partly from an inherent
nobility of nature, partly through family alliances and a more sustained
intercourse with their English kindred, partly perhaps from the inveterate
feud of their house with the Geraldines of Kildare, remained true to their
allegiance, and maintained the English authority so far as their power
<span class="sidenote">The desire of the Ormonds to maintain the English rule greater
than their power.</span>
extended. That power, unfortunately, was incommensurate with their good
will, and their situation prevented them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
from rendering the assistance to
the crown which they desired. Wexford, Wicklow, and the mountains of
Dublin, were occupied by the Highland tribes of O'Bryne and O'Toole, who,
in their wild glens and dangerous gorges, defied attempts to conquer them,
and who were able, at all times, issuing down out of the passes of the
hills, to cut off communication with the pale. Thus the Butlers had no
means of reaching Dublin except through the county of Kildare, the home of
their hereditary rivals and foes.</p>

<p>This is a general account of the situation of the various parties in
Ireland at the beginning of the sixteenth century. I have spoken only of
the leading families; and I have spoken of them as if they possessed some
feudal supremacy,&mdash;yet even this slight thread of order was in many cases
without real consistency, and was recognised only when fear, or passion, or
<span class="sidenote">Sixty chief lords in Ireland, who made war and peace for
themselves, and obeyed only the sword.</span>
interest, prompted. "There be sixty counties, called regions, in Ireland,"
says the report of 1515, "inhabited with the king's Irish enemies, some
regions as big as a shire, some more, some less, where reigneth more than
sixty chief captains, whereof some calleth themselves kings, some king's
peers in their language, some princes, some dukes, that liveth only by the
sword, and obeyeth to no other temporal person save only to himself that is
strong. And every of the said captains maketh war and peace for himself,
and holdeth by the sword, and hath imperial jurisdiction, and obeyeth no
other person, English or Irish, except only to such persons as may subdue
him by the sword.... Also, in every of the said regions, there be divers
petty captains, and every of them maketh war and peace for himself, without
licence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">In each of these sixty districts divers petty captains, who
claimed a like independence.</span>
his chief captain.... And there be more than thirty of the
English noble folk that followeth this same Irish order, and keepeth the
same rule."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
Every man, in short, who could raise himself to that
dishonourable position, was captain of a troop of banditti, and counted it
his chief honour to live upon the plunder of his neighbour.</p>

<p>This condition of things might have been expected to work its own cure. The
earth will not support human life uncultivated, and men will not labour
without some reasonable hope that they will enjoy the fruit of their
<span class="sidenote">Why anarchy did not work its own cure.</span>
labour. Anarchy, therefore, is usually shortlived, and perishes of
inanition. Unruly persons must either comply with the terms on which alone
they are permitted to subsist, and consent to submit to some kind of order,
or they must die. The Irish, however, were enabled to escape from this most
wholesome provision by the recklessness of the people, who preferred any
extremity of suffering to the endurance of the least restraint, and by the
tyranny under which the labouring poor were oppressed. In England, the same
hands were trained to hold the sword and to hold the plough. The labourers
and the artisans in peace were the soldiers in war. In Ireland, labour was
treated as disgraceful; the chiefs picked out the strongest and fiercest of
their subjects, and trained them only to fight; the labourers were driven
to the field as beasts of burden, and compelled to work on the chance that
the harvest might be secured. By this precarious means, with the addition
of the wild cattle which roamed in thousands among the woods and bogs,
sufficient sustenance was extracted from the soil to support a scanty
population, the majority of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
whom were supposed to be the most wretched
<span class="sidenote">Extreme misery of the people.</span>
specimens of human nature which could be found upon the globe. "What common
folk in all this world," the report says, "is so poor, so feeble, so evil
beseen in town and field, so bestial, so greatly oppressed and trodden
under foot, fares so evil, with so great misery, and with so wretched life,
as the common folk of Ireland? What pity is here, what ruth is to report,
there is no tongue that can tell, ne person that can write. It passeth far
the orators and muses all to shew the order of the nobles, and how cruel
they entreateth the poor common people. What danger it is to the king
against God to suffer his land, whereof he bears the charge and the cure
temporal, to be in the said misorder so long without remedy. It were more
honour to surrender his claim thereto, and to make no longer prosecution
thereof, than to suffer his poor subjects always to be so oppressed, and
all the nobles of the land to be at war within themselves, always shedding
of Christian blood without remedy. The herd must render account for his
fold; and the king for his."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish and English estimate of the same phenomenon.</div>

<p>The English writer did not exaggerate the picture, for his description is
too abundantly confirmed in every page of the Celtic Annalists, with only
but a single difference. To the Englishman the perpetual disturbance
appeared a dishonour and disgrace; to the Celt it was the normal and
natural employment of human beings, in the pursuit of which lay the only
glory and the only manly pleasure.</p>

<p>A population of such a character presented in itself a difficulty
sufficiently formidable; and this difficulty was increased by the character
of the family on whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> the circumstances of their position most obliged the
English government to rely. There were two methods of maintaining the show
of English sovereignty. Either an English deputy might reside in Dublin,
supported by a standing army; or it was necessary to place confidence in
one or other of the great Irish noblemen, and to govern through him. Either
method had its disadvantages. The expense of the first was enormous, for
the pay of the common soldier was sixpence or eightpence a-day&mdash;an
equivalent of six or eight shillings; and as the arrival of an English
deputy was the signal for a union throughout Ireland of all septs and clans
against a common enemy, his presence was worse than useless, unless he
could maintain a body of efficient troops numerous enough to cope with the
coalition. At the same time the cost, great as it would have been, must
have fallen wholly on the crown, for the parliaments would make no grants
of money for the support of a mercenary army, except on extraordinary
emergencies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to choose an Irish deputy was to acquiesce in disorder,
and to lend a kind of official sanction to it. It was inexpensive, however,
and therefore convenient; and evils which were not actually felt in
perpetual demands for money, and in uncomfortable reports, could for a time
be forgotten or ignored. In this direction lay all the temptations. The
condition of the country was only made known to the English government
through the deputy, who could represent it in such colours as he pleased;
and the government could persuade themselves that evils no longer
complained of had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>This latter method, therefore, found most favour in London. Irish noblemen
were glad to accept the office
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">The government of Ireland conducted by Irish
noblemen.</span>of deputy, and to discharge it at a low
salary or none; but it was in order to abuse their authority for their
personal advantage. They indemnified themselves for their exertions to keep
order, which was not kept, by the extortion which they practised in the
name of the government which they represented; and thus deservedly made the
<span class="sidenote">Coyne and livery extorted by the deputies.</span>
English rule more than ever detested. Instead of receiving payment, they
were allowed while deputies what was called "coyne and livery"; that is to
say, they were allowed to levy military service, and to quarter their
followers on the farmers and poor gentlemen of the pale; or else to raise
fines in composition, under pretence that they were engaged in the service
of the crown. The entire cost of this system was estimated at the enormous
sum of a hundred pounds a
day.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
The exactions might have been tolerated
if the people had been repaid by protection;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
but forced as they were to
<span class="sidenote">The people unprotected even within the pale.</span>
pay black mail at the same time to the Irish borderers, the double burdens
had the effect of driving every energetic settler out of the pale, and his
place was filled by some poor Irishman whom use had made acquainted with
misery.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Geraldines of Kildare, from their position, the natural
deputies.</div>

<p>Nor was extortion the only advantage which the Irish deputies obtained from
their office. They prosecuted their private feuds with the revenues of the
state. They connived at the crimes of any chieftain who would join their
faction. Every conceivable abuse in the administration of the government
attended the possession of power by the Geraldines of Kildare, and yet by
the Geraldines it was almost inevitable that the power should be held. The
choice lay between the Kildares and the Ormonds. No other nobleman could
pretend to compete with these two. The Earls of Desmond only could take
rank as their equals; and the lordships of Desmond were at the opposite
extremity of the island. The services of the Earls of Ormond were almost
equally unavailable. When an Earl of Ormond was residing at Dublin as
deputy, he was separated from his clan by fifty miles of dangerous road.
The policy of the Geraldines was to secure the government for themselves by
making it impossible for any other person to govern; and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
appointment<span class="sidenote">The policy of the Geraldines to make the government impossible
except to themselves.</span>
of their rival was a signal for the revolt of the entire clan, both in
Leinster and Munster. The Butlers were too weak to resist this combination;
and inasmuch as they were themselves always loyal when a Geraldine was in
power, and the Geraldines were disloyal when a Butler was in power, the
desire to hush up the difficulty, and to secure a show of quiet, led to the
consistent preference of the more convenient chief.</p>

<p>There were qualities also in the Kildare family which gave them peculiar
influence, not in Ireland only, but at the English court. Living like wild
Irish in their castle at Maynooth, they appeared in London with the address
of polished courtiers. When the complaints against them became too serious
to neglect, they were summoned to give account of their conduct. They had
only to present themselves before the council, and it was at once
impossible to believe that the frank, humorous, high-minded gentlemen at
the bar could be the monsters who were charged with so fearful crimes.
Their ever-ready wit and fluent words, their show of bluntness and pretence
of simplicity, disarmed anger and dispersed calumny; and they returned on
all such occasions to Ireland more trusted than ever, to laugh at the folly
which they had duped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The eighth Earl of Kildare in rebellion against Henry VII.</div>

<p>The farce had already continued through two generations at the opening of
the Reformation. Gerald, the eighth earl, was twice in rebellion against
Henry VII. He crowned Lambert Simnel with his own hand; when Lambert Simnel
fell, he took up Perkin Warbeck; and under pretence of supporting a
competitor for the crown, carried fire and sword through Ireland. At
length, when England was quiet, Sir Edward Poynings was sent to Dublin to
put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
down this new King-maker. He took the earl prisoner, with some
<span class="sidenote">He appears before the council,</span>
difficulty, and despatched him to London, where he appeared at the
council-board, hot-handed from murder and treason. The king told him that
heavy accusations would be laid to his charge, and that he had better
choose some counsel to plead his cause. The earl looked at him with a smile
of simplicity. "I will choose the ablest in England," he said; "your
Highness I take for my counsel against these false
knaves."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The
accusations were proceeded with. Among other enormities, Kildare had burnt
the cathedral at Cashel, and the archbishop was present as witness and
prosecutor. The earl confessed his offence: "but by Jasus," he added, "I
would not have done it if I had not been told that my lord archbishop was
inside."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
The insolent wit, and the danger of punishing so popular a
<span class="sidenote">Who decide that since Ireland cannot govern him, he must govern
Ireland.</span>
nobleman, passed the reply as sufficient. The council laughed. "All Ireland
cannot govern this earl," said one. "Then let this earl govern all
Ireland," was the prompt answer of Henry VII.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> He was sent over a
convicted traitor,&mdash;he returned a knight of the Garter, lord deputy, and
the representative of the crown. Rebellion was a successful policy, and a
lesson which corresponded so closely to the Irish temper was not forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rebellion prospers with the Geraldines</div>

<p>"What, thou fool," said Sir Gerald Shaneson to a younger son of this
nobleman, thirty years later, when he found him slow to join the rebellion
against Henry VIII. "What, thou fool, thou shalt be the more esteemed for
it. For what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> hadst thou, if thy father had not done so? What was he until
he crowned a king here, took Garth, the king's captain, prisoner, hanged
his son, resisted Poynings and all deputies; killed them of Dublin upon
Oxmantown Green; would suffer no man to rule here for the king but himself!
Then the king regarded him, and made him deputy, and married thy mother to
him;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> or else thou shouldst never have had a foot of land, where now
thou mayest dispend four hundred marks by the year."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>These scornful words express too truly the position of the Earl of Kildare,
which, however, he found it convenient to disguise under a decent exterior.
The borders of the pale were partially extended; the O'Tooles were driven
further into the Wicklow mountains, and an outlying castle was built to
overawe them at Powerscourt. Some shadow of a revenue was occasionally
raised; and by this show of service, and because change would involve the
crown in expense, he was allowed to go his own way. He held his ground till
the close of his life, and dying, he left behind him a son trained on his
father's model, and who followed with the utmost faithfulness in his
father's steps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gerald, ninth earl, becomes deputy, 1513.</div>

<p>Gerald, son of Gerald, ninth earl, became deputy, almost it seemed by right
of inheritance, in 1513; and things were allowed to continue in their old
course for another five years; when at length Henry VIII. awoke to the
disgrace which the condition of the country reflected upon him. The report
of 1515 was the first step gained; the Earl of Ormond contributed to the
effect produced by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
report, with representations of the conduct of the
deputy, who had been fortifying his own castle with government stores; and
<span class="sidenote">Is deposed in 1520, and the Earl of Surrey takes his place.</span>
the result was a resolution to undertake measures of real vigour. In 1520,
the Earl of Kildare was deprived of his office, and sent for to England.
His place was taken by the Earl of Surrey, who of all living Englishmen
combined in the highest degree the necessary qualities of soldier and
statesman. It seemed as if the old weak forbearance was to last no longer,
and as if Ireland was now finally to learn the needful lesson of obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The report had said that the Irish could never be reformed
except by force.</div>

<p>But the first efforts to cure an inveterate evil rarely succeed; and Henry
VIII., like every other statesman who has undertaken to reform Ireland, was
to purchase experience by failure. The report had declared emphatically
that the Irish chiefs would never submit so long as they might resist, and
escape with their lives; that conciliation would be only interpreted as
weakness; and that the tyrannical lords and gentlemen must be coerced into
equity by the sword freely used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king will not believe it.</div>

<p>The king, however, was young and sanguine; he was unable to accept so hard
a conclusion; he could not believe that any body of human beings were so
hopelessly inaccessible to the ordinary means of influence as the Irish
gentlemen were represented to be. He would first try persuasion, and have
recourse to extremity only if persuasion failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Surrey is to lecture the chiefs on the principles of
government.</div>

<p>His directions to the Earl of Surrey, therefore, were that at the earliest
opportunity he should call an assembly of so many of the Irish chiefs as he
could induce to come to him, and to discourse to them upon the elementary
principles of social order and government.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
"We think it expedient," he wrote, "that when ye shall call the lords and
other captains of that our land before you, as of good congruence ye must
needs do; ye, after and amongst other overtures by your wisdom then to be

made, shall declare unto them the great decay, ruin, and desolation of that
commodious and fertile land, for lack of politic governance and good
justice; which can never be brought in order unless the unbridled
sensualities of insolent folk be brought under the rule of the laws. For
realms without justice be but tyrannies and robberies, more consonant to
beastly appetites than to the laudable life of reasonable creatures. And
whereas wilfulness doth reign by strength without law or justice, there is
no distinction of propriety in dominion; ne yet any man may say this is

to expel them from their lands and dominions lawfully possessed; ne yet
that we be minded to constrain them precisely to obey our laws, ministered

laws be good and reasonable, they may be approved; and the

laws, if they shall think them too hard, be mitigated and brought to such
moderation as they may conveniently live under the same. By which means ye
shall finally induce them of necessity to conform their order of living to

used heretofore."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>So wrote Henry in 1520, being then twenty-eight years old, in his
inexperience of human nature, and especially of the Irish form of it. No
words could be truer, wiser, or more generous; but those only listen
effectively to words of wisdom and generosity, who themselves possess
something of the same qualities; and the Irish would not have required that
such an address should be made to them if they had been capable of
<span class="sidenote">Surrey greeted with instant rebellion,<br /><br />
instigated by Kildare.</span>
profiting by it. If Surrey was sanguine of any good result, he was soon
undeceived. He had no sooner landed than the whole country was in arms
against him,&mdash;O'Neile, O'Carroll, O'Connor, O'Brien, Desmond, broke into
simultaneous rebellion, acting, as was proved by intercepted
letters,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
under instructions which Kildare had sent from England. Surrey saw at a
<span class="sidenote">Advice of Surrey to do all or nothing.</span>
glance the justice of the language of the report. He informed Wolsey
briefly of the state of the country, and advised that unless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> the king was
prepared for extreme measures, he should not waste money in partial
efforts.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Writing subsequently to Henry himself, he said that the work
to be done was a repetition of the conquest of Wales by Edward I, and it
would prove at least, as tedious and as expensive. Nevertheless, if the
king could make up his mind to desire it, there was no insuperable
difficulty. He would undertake the work himself with six thousand men. The
difficulty would be then, however, but half overcome, for the habits of the
people were incurable. Strong castles must be built up and down the island,
like those at Conway and Carnarvon; and a large immigration would be
necessary of English colonists.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Either as much as this should be done,
the earl thought, or nothing. Half measures only made bad into worse; and a
policy of repression, if not consistently maintained, was unjust and
pernicious. It encouraged the better affected of the inhabitants to show
their good will to the government; and when the Irish were again in power,
these persons were marked for vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king persists in a middle way; and Surrey at length desires
his recal.</div>

<p>Practical experience was thus laid against Henry's philosophy; and it would
have been well if the king could have discerned clearly on which side the
truth was likely to lie. For the misfortune of Ireland, this was not the
case. It was inconvenient at the moment to undertake a costly conquest.
Surrey was maintained with a short retinue, and from want of power could
only enter upon a few partial expeditions. He inflicted a heavy defeat upon
O'Neile; he stormed a castle of O'Connor's; and showed, with the small
means at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> disposal, what he might have done with far less support than
he had required. He went where he pleased through the country. But his
course was "as the way of a ship through the sea, or as the way of a bird
through the air." The elements yielded without resistance, and closed in
behind him; and, after eighteen months of manful exertion, feeling the
uselessness of further enterprises conducted on so small a scale, to the
sorrow and alarm of the Irish council, he desired and obtained his
recal.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare finds favour.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in England, the Earl of Kildare had made good use of his
opportunities. In spite of his detected letters, he had won his way into
favour. He accompanied Henry to the Field of the Cloth of Gold, where he
distinguished himself by his brilliant bearing; and instead of punishing
him as a traitor, the king allowed him to marry Lady Elizabeth Grey,
<span class="sidenote">Kildare returns to Ireland. Lord Ormond deputy.<br /><br />
The Geraldines rebel,</span>
daughter of the Marquis of Dorset, and nearly related to the blood royal.
He was permitted to return to Ireland; not, however, immediately as deputy.
An intermediate effort was made to govern through Lord Ormond, whose
intentions were excellent, but unfortunately the Irish refused to submit to
him. The Earl of Desmond remained in rebellion, and invaded Kilkenny from
the south; and two years followed of universal insurrection, pillage, and
murder. Kildare accused Ormond to the English council as
responsible;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
Ormond retorted with similar charges against Kildare; and commissioners
were sent over to "investigate," with instructions, if they saw reason, to
replace Kildare in his old office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And Kildare is restored.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The permission was sufficient; in 1524 he was again deputy; and no
deliberate purpose of misrule could have led to results more fatal. The
earl, made bold by impunity, at once prepared for a revolt from the English
crown. Hitherto he had been contented to make himself essential to the
maintenance of the English sovereignty; he now launched out into bolder
measures, and encouraged by Henry's weakness, resolved to dare the worst
<span class="sidenote">Desmond makes a league with Francis I.,<br /><br />

extremity. On the breaking out of the French war of 1523-24, his kinsman,
the Earl of Desmond, opened a negotiation with Francis I. for the landing
of a French army in Munster.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
Kildare, while professing that he was
endeavouring to take Desmond prisoner, was holding secret interviews with
him to concert plans for a united
move,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
and was strengthening himself
at the same time with alliances among the native chiefs. One of his
daughters became the wife of the O'Connor; another married O'Carroll, of
Leap Castle; and a third the Baron of
Slane;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
and to leave no doubt of
his intentions, he transferred the cannon and military stores from Dublin
Castle to his own fortress at Maynooth. Lord Ormond sent information to
England of these proceedings, but he could gain no hearing. For three years
<span class="sidenote">The state of Ireland becomes at last dangerous.</span>
the Geraldines were allowed to continue their preparations undisturbed; and
perhaps they might have matured their plans at leisure, so odious had
become the mention of Ireland to the English statesmen, had not the king's
divorce,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
by embroiling him with the pope and emperor, made the danger
serious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond applies to the emperor.</div>

<p>The alliance of England and France had disconcerted the first scheme. No
sooner was this new opportunity opened than, with Kildare's consent,
Desmond applied to Charles V. with similar
overtures.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
This danger was
too serious to be neglected;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and in 1527, Kildare was a second time
summoned to London. He went, so
<span class="sidenote">Kildare again in London, and committed to the Tower.<br /><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
confident was he of the weakness of the
government, and again he was found to have calculated justly. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> was
arraigned before the council, overwhelmed with invectives by
Wolsey,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
and sent to the Tower. But he escaped by his old art. No sooner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> was he
committed, than Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, who had accompanied him to
England, hurried back across the Channel to the castle of her
brother-in-law, O'Connor.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The robber chief instantly rose and attacked
the pale. The Marchers opened their lines to give his banditti free passage
into the interior;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and he seized and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> carried off prisoner the Baron
of Delvin, who had been made vice-deputy on Kildare's departure. Desmond
meanwhile held Ormond in check at Kilkenny, and prevented him from sending
assistance to Dublin; and the Irish council were at once prostrate and
helpless.</p>

<p>Henry VIII., on receipt of this intelligence, instead of sending Kildare to
the block and equipping an army, condescended to write a letter of
remonstrance to O'Connor. "A letter from the king!" said the insolent
chieftain when it was brought to him, "what king! If I may live one year, I
trust to see Ireland in that case that there shall be no more mention here
of the King of England than of the King of
Spain,"<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
Still, however, it
was thought inconvenient to venture extremities. Henry allowed himself to
make use of Kildare's assistance to soothe the immediate
storm.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
An old desire of the Irish had been that some prince of the blood should govern
<span class="sidenote">The Duke of Richmond viceroy.</span>
them;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
he nominated therefore, his natural son, the Duke of Richmond as
viceroy; and having no adequate force in Ireland to resist an insurrection,
and no immediate means of despatching any such force, he was once more
obliged to pardon and restore the traitorous Geraldine; appointing, at the
<span class="sidenote">Skeffington made deputy to govern with the help of Kildare.</span>
same time, Sir William Skeffington, a moderately able man, though too old
for duty, as the Duke of Richmond's deputy, and directing him to govern
with the advice and co&ouml;peration of the Earl of Kildare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Allen appointed Archbishop of Dublin.</div>

<p>To this disastrous weakness there was but one counterpoise&mdash;that the
English party in the council of Ireland was strengthened by the
ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>pointment of John Allen to the archbishopric of Dublin and the office of
chancellor. Allen was one of the many men of talent who owed their
elevation to Wolsey. He was now sent over to keep watch on Kildare, and to
supply the government with accurate information which might be relied upon
as a ground for action. Till this time (and the fact is one which ought to
be borne in mind), the government had been forced to depend for their
knowledge of the state of the country either on the representations of the
deputy, or the private accusations of his personal enemies; both of them
exceedingly untrustworthy sources. Henceforward there runs a clear stream
of light through the fog and night of confusion, furnished either by the
archbishop or by Allen, Master of the Rolls, who was most likely his
kinsman.</p>

<p>The policy of conciliation, if conduct so feeble deserves to be called a
policy at all, had now reached its limit; and it amounted to confessed
imbecility. Twice deposed from power on clear evidence of high treason,
Lord Kildare was once more restored. It cost him but a little time to
<span class="sidenote">Kildare a third time deputy.</span>
deliver himself of the presence of Skeffington; and in 1532 he was again
sole deputy. All which the Earl of Surrey had foretold came to pass.
Archbishop Allen was deprived of the chancellorship, and the Archbishop of
Armagh, a creature of the Geraldines, was substituted in his place. Those
noblemen and gentlemen who had lent themselves to the interests of the
English in the earl's absence were persecuted, imprisoned, or murdered.
They had ventured to be loyal from a belief in the assurances which had
been made to them; but the government was far off and Kildare was near; and
such of them as he condescended to spare "were now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
driven in self-defence,
maugre their wills, to follow with the
rest."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
The wind which filled
<span class="sidenote">Saturnalia of madness.</span>
the sails of the ship in which Kildare returned, blew into flames the fires
of insurrection; and in a very Saturnalia of Irish madness the whole
people, with no object that could be discovered but for very delight in
disorder itself, began to tear themselves to pieces. Lord Thomas Butler was
murdered by the Geraldines; Kildare himself was shot through the body in a
skirmish; Powerscourt was burnt by the O'Tooles; and Dublin Castle was
sacked in a sudden foray by O'Brien Oge. O'Neile was out in the north;
Desmond in the south; and the English pale was overrun by
brigands.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
Ireland had found its way into its ideal condition&mdash;that condition towards
<span class="sidenote">Despatch of the two Allens.</span>
which its instincts perpetually tended, and which at length it had
undisputedly reached. The Allens furnished the king with a very plain
report of the effect of his leniency. They dwelt boldly on the mistakes
which had been made. Re&euml;choing the words of the Report of 1515, they
declared that the only hope for the country was to govern by English
deputies; and that to grudge the cost seemed "consonant to the nature of
him that rather than he will depart with fourpence he will jeopard to lose
twenty shillings&mdash;which fourpence, disbursed in time, might have saved the
other."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
They spoke well of the common Irish. "If well governed," they
said, "the Irish would be found as civil, politic, and active, as any other
nation. But what subjects under any prince in the world," they asked,
"would love or defend the rights of that prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
who, notwithstanding their
true hearts and obedience, would afterwards put them under the governance
of such as would persecute and destroy them?" Faith must be kept with those
<span class="sidenote">Till great men suffered there would be no peace in
Ireland.</span>
to whom promises had been made, and the habit of rewarding treason with
concessions must be brought to an end. "Till great men suffer for their
offences," they added, significantly, "your subjects within the English
pale shall never live in quietness, nor stand sure of their goods and
lives. Therefore, let your deputy have in commandment to do justice upon
great thieves and malefactors, and to spare your pardons."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>These were but words, and such words had been already spoken too often to
deaf ears; but the circumstances of the time were each day growing more
perilous, and necessity, the true mother of statesmanship, was doing its
work at last.</p>

<p>The winter months passed away, bringing only an increase of wretchedness.
At length opened the eventful year of 1534, and Henry learnt that
excommunication was hanging over him&mdash;that a struggle for life or death had
commenced&mdash;and that the imperial armies were preparing to strike in the
quarrel. From that time onward the King of England became a new man.
<span class="sidenote">Henry awakes at last.</span>
Hitherto he had hesitated, temporized, delayed&mdash;not with Ireland only, but
with the manifold labours which were thrust upon him. At last he was awake.
And, indeed, it was high time. With a religious war apparently on the eve
of explosion, he could ill tolerate a hotbed of sedition at his door; and
Irish sedition was about to receive into itself a new element, which was to
make it trebly dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The religious element is introduced into Irish sedition.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Until that moment the disorders in Ireland had arisen out of a natural
preference for anarchy. Every man's hand was against his neighbour, and the
clans made war on each other only for revenge and plunder and the wild
delight of the game. These private quarrels were now to be merged in a
single cause&mdash;a cause which was to lend a fresh stimulus to their hatred of
England, and was at once to create and consecrate a national Irish spirit.</p>

<p>The Irish were eminently Catholic; not in the high sense of the word,&mdash;for
"the noble folk" could "oppress and spoil the prelates of the Church of
Christ of their possessions and liberties" without particular
scruple,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>&mdash;but the country was covered with churches and monasteries in
a proportion to the population far beyond what would have been found in any
other country in Europe; and there are forms of superstition which can walk
hand in hand with any depth of crime, when that superstition is provided
<span class="sidenote">The pope finds in the Irish a ready-made army.</span>
with a talisman which will wash away the stains of guilt. The love of
fighting was inherent, at the same time, in the Celtic nature. And such a
people, when invited to indulge their humour in the cause or the church,
were an army of insurrection ready made to the hands of the popes, the
value of which their Holinesses were not slow to learn, as they have not
been quick to forget.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Henry was aware of the correspondence of Desmond with the emperor. He,
perhaps, also expected that the fiction might be retorted upon him (as it
actually was)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> which had been invented to justify the first conquest of the
island. If Ireland was a fief of the pope, the same power which had made a
present of it to Henry II. might as justly take it away from Henry VIII.;
and the peril of his position roused him at length to an effort. It was an
effort still clogged by fatality, and less than the emergency required: but
it was a beginning, and it was something.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February. Kildare a third time called to England.</div>

<p>In February, 1534, a month before Clement pronounced his sentence, the Earl
of Kildare was required, for the third and last time, to appear and answer
for his offences; and a third time he ventured to obey. But England had
become a changed world in the four years which had passed since his last
presence there, and the brazen face and fluent lips were to serve him no
<span class="sidenote">Kildare is sent to the Tower.</span>
more. On his arrival in London he was sent to the Tower, and discovered
that he had overstepped his limits at last.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> He was now shrewd enough
to see that, if a revolt was contemplated, no time was to be lost. He must
play his last card, or his influence was gone for ever. Lord Thomas
<span class="sidenote">Lord Thomas Fitzgerald vice-deputy.</span>
Fitzgerald, his eldest son, who in his boyhood had resided in England,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
had been left as vice-deputy in his father's absence. The earl before his
departure had taken precautions to place the fortresses of the pale, with
the arms and ammunition belonging to the government, in the hands of
dependents whom he could absolutely trust. No sooner was his arrest known
than, in compliance with secret instructions which had been left with them,
or were sent from England, his friends determined upon rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The opportunity was well chosen. The government of Ireland was in disorder.
Skeffington was designed for Kildare's successor, but he was not yet
appointed; nor was he to cross the Channel till he had collected a strong
body of troops, which was necessarily a work of time. The conditional
excommunication of the king was then freshly published; and counsels, there
is reason to think, were guiding the Irish movement, which had originated
<span class="sidenote">June. The emperor sends an agent to the Earl of Desmond.</span>
in a less distempered brain than that of an Irish chieftain. Rumours were
flying in the southern counties in the middle of June that a Spanish
invasion might be immediately looked for, and the emperor's chaplain was
with the Earl of Desmond. His mission, it was said, was to prepare the way
for an imperial army; and Desmond himself was fortifying Dungarvan, the
port at which an invading force could most conveniently land.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> There
is, therefore, a strong probability that Charles V., who had undertaken to
execute the papal sentence in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> course of the summer, was looking for
the most vulnerable point at which to strike; and, not venturing to invade
England, was encouraging an Irish rebellion, with a view to following up
his success if the commencement proved auspicious.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Thomas Fitzgerald proclaims Henry accursed, and calls on
the country to rise.</div>

<p>Simultaneously with the arrival of these unwelcome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> news, the English
government were informed by letters from Dublin, that Lord Thomas
Fitzgerald had thrown off his allegiance, and had committed infinite
murders, burnings, and robbings in the English pale; making "his avaunt and
boast that he was of the pope's sect and band, and that him he would serve,
against the king and all his partakers; that the King of England was
accursed, and as many as took his
part."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
The signal for the explosion
was given with a theatrical bravado suited to the novel dignity of the
cause. Never before had an Irish massacre been graced by a papal sanction,
and it was necessary to mark the occasion by unusual form. The young lord,
Silken Thomas, as he was called, was twenty-one years old, an accomplished
Irish cavalier. He was vice-deputy, or so he considered himself: and
unwilling to tarnish the honour of his loyal house by any action which
could be interpreted into treachery, he commenced with a formal surrender
<span class="sidenote">June 11. He appears before the council in St. Mary's abbey, and
declares formal war.</span>
of his office, and a declaration of war. On the eleventh of June the
council were sitting in St. Mary's abbey, when a galloping of horses was
heard, and Lord Thomas, at the head of a hundred and forty of the young
Geraldines, dashed up to the gate, and springing off his horse, strode into
the assembly. The council rose, but he ordered them to sit still, and
taking the sword of state in his hand, he spoke in Irish to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"However injuriously we be handled, and forced to defend ourselves in arms,
when neither our service, nor our good meaning towards our prince's crown
availeth, yet say not hereafter, but in this open hostility which we
profess here, and proclaim, we have showed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> ourselves no villains nor
churls, but warriors and gentlemen. This sword of state is yours, and not
mine; I received it with an oath and have used it to your benefit. I should
offend mine honour if I turned the same to your annoyance. Now I have need
of mine own sword which I dare trust. As for this common sword, it
flattereth me with a golden scabbard; but it hath in it a pestilent edge,
and whetteth itself in hope of a destruction. Save yourselves from us, as
from open enemies. I am none of Henry's deputy; I am his foe; I have more
mind to conquer than to govern, to meet him in the field than to serve him
in office. If all the hearts of England and Ireland that have cause thereto
would join in this quarrel, as I trust they will, then should he be a
byword, as I trust he shall, for his heresy, lechery, and tyranny; wherein
the age to come may score him among the ancient princes of most abominable
and hateful memory."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> "With that," says Campion, "he rendered up his
sword, adding to his shameful oration many other slanderous and foul
terms."</p>

<p>Cromer, Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Armagh, a creature of Kildare,
"more like his parish priest or chaplain, than king's
chancellor,"<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> who
had been prepared beforehand, rose, and affected remonstrance; but,
speaking in English, his words were not understood by the crowd. A bard in
the Geraldine train cut short his speech with an Irish battle chant; and
the wild troop rushed, shouting, out of the abbey, and galloped from the
town.</p>

<p>In these mock heroics there need not have been anything worse than folly;
<span class="sidenote">Pillage and massacre.</span>

Irish religion, was unfortunately limited to words
and feelings. The generous defiance in the cause of the Catholic faith was
followed by pillage and murder, the usual accompaniments of Irish
insurrection, as a sort of initial holocaust to propitiate success. The
open country was at the mercy of the rebels. Fitzgerald, joined by
<span class="sidenote">The people of the pale join the rebels.</span>
O'Connor, proceeded to swear-in all such of the inhabitants of the pale as
would unite against England; promising protection if they would consent,
but inflicting fire and sword wherever he met refusal. The unfortunate
people, warned by experience that no service was worse requited in Ireland
than loyalty, had no spirit to resist. The few who were obnoxious were
killed; the remainder submitted; and the growing corn was destroyed, and
the farms were burnt, up to the gates of Dublin, that when the English army
arrived, they might find neither food to maintain, nor houses to shelter
them.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
<span class="sidenote">He summons Dublin.</span>
The first object of Fitzgerald, however, was to seize Dublin
itself, where a portion of the citizens were in his favour. In the last
week in July he appeared with his followers under the walls; a small force
which had attempted to resist was defeated and driven in; and, under a
threat of burning the city, if he was refused, he demanded the surrender of
town and castle. The danger was immediate. The provident treachery of
Kildare, in stripping the castle of its stores and cannon, had made defence
all but impossible. Ormond was far off, and weeks must pass before relief
could arrive from England. Sir John White, an English gentleman, with a
handful of men-at-arms, had military command of the city; and the
Archbishop of Armagh implored him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
to have pity on the citizens, and not to expose them to the consequences of a
storm.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Archbishop Cromer implores Sir John White, the English
commander, to surrender.</span>
White was too stout a
soldier to listen to such timid counsels; yet his position was one of
extreme difficulty; his little garrison was too weak to defend the lines of
the town, without the assistance of the citizens, and the citizens were
divided and dispirited. He resolved at, length to surrender the city, and
defend the castle to the last. Fitzgerald threatened that he would hold the
townsmen responsible for the submission of the troops; but, savage as the
English commander knew him to be, he calculated, with justice, that he
would not ruin his popularity by cutting the throats of an unresisting
crowd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White surrenders the city, and withdraws into the castle.</div>

<p>Hastily gathering together sufficient stores to enable him to hold out for
a few weeks, and such arms and ammunition as could be collected in the
emergency, White withdrew into the fortress, taking with him the Master of
the Rolls, the Chief Baron, and such other of the council as desired to be
his companions. The inhabitants of Dublin were then empowered to make terms
with the rebels. The gates were opened on Fitzgerald's promise to respect
life and property, the city was occupied, and siege was immediately laid to
<span class="sidenote">Siege of the castle, July 27.<br /><br />

the castle. This was on the 27th of July. The morning which followed was
marked by one of those atrocities which have so often unfortunately
distinguished Irish rebellions. Archbishop Allen, to whose exertions the
exposure of Kildare's proceedings had been principally due, either fearing
the possible consequences to himself if the castle was taken, as the Irish
writers say,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
or more probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
to hasten in person the arrival of the
deputy and his troops, instead of remaining with White, volunteered to
cross to England; and before the gates were opened, he went on board a
vessel and dropped down the river. He had placed himself unknowingly in the
hands of traitors, for the ship was commanded by a

Geraldine,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and in
the night which followed was run aground at Clontarf, close to the mouth of
the Liffey. The country was in possession of the insurgents, the crew were
accomplices, and the stranded vessel, on the retreat of the tide, was soon
surrounded. The archbishop was partly persuaded, partly compelled to go on
shore, and was taken by two dependents of the Earl of Kildare to a farm
house in the village of Artayne. Here he was permitted to retire to bed;
but if he slept, it was for an early and a cruel wakening. The news of his
capture was carried to Fitzgerald, who was then in the city, but a few
miles distant, and the young lord, with three of his uncles, was on the
spot by daybreak. They entered the house and ordered Allen to be brought
before them. The archbishop was dragged from his bed; and in his shirt as
he was, bare-legged and bare-headed, he dropt upon his knees, and begged
<span class="sidenote">And murdered.</span>
for mercy. As well might the sheep have asked mercy of the famished wolf.
He had but time to bequeath his soul to heaven, and his skull was cloven as
he knelt; and, to make clean work, his chaplains, his servants, all of
English blood who were with him, were slaughtered over his
body.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Such
was the pious offering to God and holy church on which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> sun looked down
as it rose that fair summer's morning over Dublin Bay; and such were the
men whose cause the Mores and the Fishers, the saintly monks of the
Charterhouse and the holy martyrs of the Catholic faith, believed to be the
cause of the Almighty Father of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgerald writes to the pope and the emperor to announce his
exploit.</div>

<p>The morning's work was still but half completed. To massacre a heretic
archbishop was a meritorious, or at least a venial act; but it was
desirable that an opinion in favour of it should be pronounced by
authority; or that the guilt, if guilt there was, should be washed off
without delay. The Archdeacon of
Kells,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
therefore, was despatched to

Holiness,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> if the
murder required it. The next object was to prevent news from reaching
<span class="sidenote">Blockade of Dublin Bay.</span>
England before the castle should be taken. The river was watched, the
timely assistance of an English pirate enabled Fitzgerald to blockade the
bay; and Dublin was effectively sealed. But the report of the murder spread
rapidly through Ireland. In three days it was known at Waterford; and the
<span class="sidenote">The Prior of Kilmainham crosses with the news from Waterford.</span>
Prior of Kilmainham,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> who had taken refuge there, crossed into Wales on
the instant, intending to ride post to London.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> He was delayed at St.

left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> Ireland with him; and the death of the archbishop was made known to
Henry in the second week in August.</p>

<p>If Skeffington could set out on the instant, the castle might be saved, and
Dublin recovered. Couriers were despatched to urge him to make haste; and
others were sent to Ireland to communicate with Ormond, and, if possible,

with the party in the castle. But Skeffington, who was too old for his
work, had loitered over his preparations, and was not ready; and the delay
would have been fatal, except for the Earl of Ormond, the loyalty of whose
noble house at that crisis alone saved the English authority in Ireland. On
the arrival of Henry's courier, he collected his people and invaded
Kildare. The country was unenclosed&mdash;not a fence nor a hedge broke the
broad surface of moor and meadow, save where at intervals a few small
patches were enclosed for corn crops. Infinite herds of cattle grazed at
will over the expanse of pasture, and these cattle were the chief
dependence of the people. Ormond, by the suddenness of his inroad, and the
absence of the owners, was enabled to sweep clear the whole tract which was
occupied by the Geraldines; and Fitzgerald was forced to retire from Dublin
to defend or recover his property. He left a detachment in the city, to
prevent the troops in the castle from obtaining
supplies,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and then
hurried off to revenge the foray. Entering Carlow, he took a castle on the
Slaney, and murdered the garrison. Thence he turned towards Kilkenny, and
was bearing down upon Ormond with a strength which it would have been hard
for the Butlers to resist, when he learnt that the citizens of Dublin,
encouraged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
by the news that an English army was actually coming, had
repented of their patriotism, and, to earn their pardon from Henry, had
closed their gates, and had seized and imprisoned the party who were left
before the castle. The prize for which he had played so deeply was slipping
from his hands at the moment when it was all but won. He was forced to
return in haste; but before he left Kilkenny, he made an effort to induce
Ormond to join him. He promised, that, if the earl would assist him in
driving out the English, he would "take him as his father," that he would
make a present to his son, Lord James, of half the inheritance of the
Kildares, and that they two should together rule Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Promises when extorted by presence of danger from a Geraldine were of
indifferent value; but if Fitzgerald's engagements had been as sure as they
were false and fleeting, they would have weighed little with this gallant
<span class="sidenote">Ormond's reply.</span>
old nobleman. Ormond replied, that, if the rebels would lay down their arms
and sue for mercy, they might perhaps find it; but for himself, "if his
country were wasted, his castles won or prostrate, and himself exiled, yet
would he never shrink to persevere in his duty to the king to the
death."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
Failing here, and having at the same time received a check in
a skirmish, Fitzgerald next endeavoured to gain time. The Irish clans were
gathering, but they were still at a distance, and his own presence was
instantly required elsewhere. He offered a truce, therefore; and to this
Ormond, being hard pressed by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Fitzgerald's treachery.</span>
Earl of Desmond, was ready to consent.
But it was only treachery. Ormond broke up his camp, and his people were
scattered; and within three days, O'Neile having joined Fitzgerald, he was
taken at a disadvantage; his son, Lord James, was severely wounded; and a
cordon of Irish being drawn round him, to prevent him from relieving
<span class="sidenote">Dublin is again besieged.<br /><br />September.</span>
Dublin, the rebel army hastened back to renew the
siege.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> They had the
cannon with them which Kildare had taken from the
castle,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> but were
happily ill-provided with ammunition, or resistance would have been
desperate. The siege opened at the beginning of September. The month passed
<span class="sidenote"><br /><br />Skeffington does not arrive.</span>
away, and the place was still untaken. If the deputy would only arrive,
there was still time to save it. Each hour he was looked for, yet through
these priceless days he was loitering at Beaumaris. From the fatality which
has for ever haunted the dealings of English statesmen with Ireland, an old
man past work, weak in health, and with all the moral deficiencies of a
failing constitution, had been selected to encounter a dangerous rebellion.
The insurrection had broken out in June; every moment was precious, the
<span class="sidenote">October 4.</span>
loss of a day might be the loss of the whole country; yet it was now the
fourth of October; the ships were loaded; the horses were on board; they
had been on board a fortnight, and were sickening from confinement. The
wind was fair, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that critical season of the year a matter of
<span class="sidenote">Ormond again saves Dublin.</span>
incalculable importance. Yet Skeffington was still "not
ready."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> All
would have been lost but for the Earl of Ormond. The city was at the last
extremity, when he contrived to force his way through the Irish into
Kildare; he again laid waste the country, and destroyed the newly-gathered
harvests.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Siege of Dublin raised, October 14.</span>
On the 14th of October Fitzgerald was forced finally to
raise the siege, that his followers might save the remnant of their
property from destruction. The relief was but just in time, for the
resources of Dublin were exhausted. Before retreating, the rebel lord
exacted from the corporation an engagement that at the end of six weeks
they should either have procured his pardon from the king, with the
deputation of Ireland for his life, or else should surrender the city. For
the fulfilment of these insolent terms he took as pledges sixteen of the
children of the most important families of the city, with three of the
corporation themselves.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The English army sails at last.</div>

<p>And now, at length, on the same 14th of October, the English anchors were
finally raised, and the deputy, with Sir William Brereton and Sir John
Salisbury, several hundred Northumberland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> horse trained in the Border

archers and men-at-arms,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> were under way. Whether the blame of the
delay lay with the incompetency of Skeffington, or the contempt of the
English, which would not allow them to make haste into the presence of an
enemy who never dared to encounter them in the field, but carried on war by
perjury, and pillage, and midnight murder&mdash;whatever the cause was, they
were at length on their way, and, through the devotion of Ormond, not too
late to be of use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They cross in a single night.<br /><br />
Council of war at Lambay Island.</div>

<p>The fleet crossed the Channel in a single night, and the next morning were
under Lambay Island,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> where they had run in for shelter. Here news was
brought them that Dublin Castle was taken. They did not believe it; but a
council of war was held, and Skeffington resolved that for himself he might
not risk the attempt to land; Brereton and Salisbury might try it, if they
could do so "without casting themselves away"; the deputy would go on to
Waterford with the body of the army, and join Sir John St. Loo, who had
crossed to that port in the week preceding, from Bristol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir William Brereton with 500 men enters the Liffey.</div>

<p>Accordingly, on the morning of the 17th of October, Sir William Brereton,
with five hundred men, sailed into the mouth of the Liffey; and running up
the river, instead of an enemy drawn up to oppose his landing, he found the
mayor and corporation waiting at the quay, with drums, and flags, and
trumpets to welcome him as a deliverer.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An English detachment cut off through Skeffington's imprudence.</div>

<p>Skeffington was less successful; he remained under Lambay waiting for a
wind for Waterford, and in the meantime Fitzgerald, hearing of the arrival
of the fleet, was in force upon the hills overlooking the anchorage. The
English commander, though aware that the insurgents were in the
neighbourhood, allowed himself, with extreme imprudence, to land a
detachment of troops, with directions to march to Dublin. He himself went
with the fleet to the Skerries,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> where he conceived, under false
information, that a party of the rebels were lying. He found nothing there
but a few fishing-boats; and while he was engaged in burning these,
Fitzgerald attacked the division which had been sent on shore, and cut them
off to a man. Nor was this the only misfortune. The pirate ships which had
been watching Dublin Bay hovered round the fleet, cutting off straggling
transports; and although one of them was chased and driven on shore, the
small success poorly counterbalanced the injury which had been
inflicted.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">October 21. Skeffington lands in Dublin,</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
After a week of this trifling, Skeffington consented to resign his
intention of going to Waterford, and followed Brereton into Dublin. Why he
had delayed a day after discovering that the river and the city were open
to him, it is impossible to conjecture. But his presence was of little
benefit, and only paralysed his abler subordinates. As soon as he had
brought his army into the city, he conceived that he had done as much as
<span class="sidenote">November. And resolves, the season being late, to do nothing.</span>
the lateness of the season would allow. The November weather having set in
wild and wet, he gave up all thought of active measures till the return of
spring; and he wrote to inform the king, with much self-approbation, that
he was busy writing letters to the Irish chiefs, and making arrangements
for a better government; that Lord Thomas Fitzgerald had been proclaimed
traitor at the market-cross; and that he hoped, as soon as the chancellor
and the vicar-general could come to an understanding, the said traitor
might be pronounced
excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
All this was very well, and we
learn to our comfort that in due time the excommunication was pronounced;
but it was not putting down the rebellion&mdash;it was not the work for which he
was sent to Ireland with three thousand English soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgerald burns Trim and Dunboyne, within six miles of Dublin.</div>

<p>Fitzgerald, as soon as the army was landed, retired into the interior; but
finding that the deputy lay idle within the walls, he recovered heart, and
at the head of a party of light horse reappeared within six miles of
Dublin. Trim and Dunboyne, two populous villages, were sacked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and burnt,
and the blazing ruins must have been seen from the battlements of the
Castle. Yet neither the insults of the rebels nor the entreaty of the
inhabitants could move the imperturbable Skeffington. He lay still within
the city walls;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
<span class="sidenote">He again writes to the emperor.</span>
and Fitzgerald, still further encouraged, despatched a
fresh party of ecclesiastics to the pope and the emperor, with offers of
allegiance and promises of
tribute,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
giving out meanwhile in Ireland
that he would be supported in the spring or summer by the long talked-of
Spanish army. Promises costing Charles V. nothing, he was probably liberal
of them, and waited for the issue to decide how far they should be
observed.</p>

<p>If this was so, the English deputy seemed to be determined to give the
rebellion every chance of issuing as the emperor desired. The soldiers were
eager for employment, but Skeffington refused to give his officers an
opportunity for distinction in which he did not share,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and a few
ineffectual skirmishes in the neighbourhood were the sole exploits which
for five months they were allowed to achieve. One expedition, as far

<span class="sidenote">Skeffington ventures an expedition to Drogheda, and brings back

Drogheda, the deputy indeed ventured, towards the end of November; and in
the account of it which he sent to England, he wrote as if it were matter
of congratulation that he had brought his army back in safety. Nor were his
congratulations, at least to himself, without reason, for he owed that
safety to God and to fortune. He had allowed the archers to neglect the old
precaution of taking cases for their bows. They were overtaken by a storm,
which wetted the strings and loosened the feathers of the arrows; and thus,
at disadvantage, they were intercepted in a narrow
defile,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and escaped
only because the Irish were weak in numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He excuses himself on the ground of bad health.</div>

<p>He excused himself for his shortcomings on the plea that he was in bad
health&mdash;an adequate apology for his own inaction, but none for his
appointment on a service so dangerous. Yet perhaps his failure is explained
by the scene of it. Elsewhere, Sir William Skeffington may have been a
gallant soldier and a reasonable man; but the fatal atmosphere of Ireland
seems at all times to have had a power of prostrating English intellect.
The Protector Cromwell alone was cased in armour which could defy its
enchantments. An active officer might have kept the field without
difficulty. The Master of the Rolls, to prove that the country, even in
mid-winter, was practicable without danger, rode to Waterford in November
with only three hundred horse, through the heart of the disturbed
districts, and returned
unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The Earl of Ossory, with Sir John
St. Loo, made an appointment to meet Skeffington at
Kilcaa,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> where, if
he brought cannon, they might recover the castles of the government which
were held by the Geraldines. He promised to go, and he might have done so
without danger or difficulty; but he neither went nor sent; only a rumour
came that the deputy was
ill;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
and in these delays and with this
ostentation of imbecility, the winter passed away, as if to convince every
wavering Irishman that, strong as the English might be in their own land,
the sword dropped from their nerveless hands when their feet were on Irish
<span class="sidenote">Consequence of the deputy's inaction.</span>
soil. Nor was this the only or the worst consequence. The army, lying idle
in Dublin, grew disorganized; many of the soldiers deserted; and an
impression spread abroad that Henry, after all, intended to return to the
old policy, to pardon Fitzgerald, and to restore him to power.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The wages, also, were ill-paid, though money in abundance had been

<p>The conduct of the king, when the representations of Allen were laid before
him, was very unlike what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
popular conception of his character would
have led us to expect. We imagine him impatient and irritable; and
supposing him to have been (as he certainly was) most anxious to see the
rebellion crushed, we should have looked for some explosion of temper; or,
at least, for some imperious or arbitrary message to the unfortunate
deputy. He contented himself, however, with calmly sending some one whom he
could trust to make inquiries; and even when the result confirmed the
<span class="sidenote">The Irish council desire the recal of Skeffington. The king
refuses.</span>
language of the Master of the Rolls, and the deputy's recal was in
consequence urged upon him, he still refused to pass an affront upon an old
servant. He appointed Lord Leonard Grey, brother-in-law of the Countess of
Kildare, chief marshal of the army; but he would not even send Grey over
till the summer, and he left Skeffington an opportunity of recovering his
reputation in the campaign which was to open with the
<span class="sidenote">The army leave Dublin, and commence work.</span>
spring.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The
army, however, was ordered to leave Dublin without delay; and the first
move, which was made early in February, was followed by immediate fruits.

Several other offenders of note were also caught and thrown
into prison; and in two instances, as if the human ministers of justice had
not been sufficiently prompt, the higher powers thought fit to inflict the
necessary punishment. John Teling, one of the archbishop's murderers, died
of a foul disorder at Maynooth;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and the Earl of Kildare, the contriver

<div class="sidenote">Death of the Earl of Kildare.<br /><br />
March 14. Skeffington takes the field. Siege of Maynooth
Castle.</div>

<p>Meantime, the spring opened at last, and affairs further improved.
Skeffington's health continued weak; but with the advance of the season he
was able to take the field; and on the 14th of March he appeared under the
walls of Maynooth. This castle was the strongest in the possession of the
Geraldines. Vast labour had been recently expended on its fortifications,
for which the king's subjects had been forced to pay. It was defended by
the ordnance from Dublin, and held by a small but adequate garrison. It was
thought to be impregnable, and in the earlier stages of the science of
gunnery it might possibly have defied the ordinary methods of attack. Nay,
with a retrospective confidence in the strength of its defences, the Irish
historians have been unable to believe that it could have been fairly
taken; they insist that it resisted the efforts of the besiegers, and was
on the point of being saved by Fitzgerald,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> when it was delivered to
the English commander by treachery. A despatch to the king, which was
written from the spot, and signed by the deputy and all the members of the
Irish council, leaves but little remaining of this romance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The walls are bombarded.</div>

<p>An authentic account of an attack by cannon on a fortified place at that
era, will scarcely fail to be interesting. The castle, says this document,
was so strongly defended both with men and ordnance, "as the like had not
been seen in Ireland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
since the Conquest." The garrison consisted of a
hundred men, of which sixty were gunners. On the third day of the siege the
English batteries opened on the north-west side of the donjon, and
destroying the battlements, buried the cannon on that part of the wall
under the ruins. The siege lines were then moved "to the north side of the
base court of the castle, at the north-east end whereof there was a
new-made, very strong, and fast bulwark, well garrisoned with men and
ordnance." Here a continual fire was sustained for five days, "on that wise
<span class="sidenote">March 23. The castle is stormed.</span>
that a breach and entry was made there." Whereupon, continues the despatch,
"The twenty-third day, being Tuesday next before Easter day, there was a
galiard assault given before five o'clock in the morning, and the base
court entered; at which entry there were slain of the ward of the castle
about sixty, and of your Grace's army no more but John Griffin, yeoman of
your most honourable guard, and six others which were killed with ordnance
of the castle at the entry. Howbeit, if it had not pleased God to preserve
us, it were to be marvelled that we had no more slain. After the base court
<span class="sidenote">Thirty-seven prisoners taken.</span>
was thus won, we assaulted the great castle, which within a while yielded."
Thirty-seven of the remaining garrison were taken prisoners, with two
officers, two Irish ecclesiastics who had distinguished themselves in
promoting the insurrection, and one of the murderers of the archbishop.</p>

<p>The place was taken by fair fighting, it seems, without need of treachery;
and the capture by storm of a fortified castle was a phenomenon altogether
new to the Irish, who had yet to learn the effect of well-served cannon
upon walls.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
The work at length was begun in earnest, and in order to drive the lesson
home into the understanding of the people, and to instruct them clearly
that rebellion and murder were not any longer to be tolerated, the
prisoners were promptly brought up before the provost-marshal, and
twenty-six of them there and then, under the ruins of their own den, were
hung up for sign to the whole nation.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pardon of Maynooth. The effect of it upon the people.</div>

<p>A judicial operation of this kind had never before been witnessed in
Ireland within the known cycle of its history, and the effect of it was
proportionately startling. In the presence of this "Pardon of Maynooth," as
it was called, the phantom of rebellion vanished on the spot. It was the
first serious blow which was struck in the war, and there was no occasion
for a second. In a moment the noise and bravado which had roared from
Donegal to Cork was hushed into a supplication for forgiveness. Fitzgerald
<span class="sidenote">The rebellion vanishes.</span>
was hastening out of Thomond to the relief of his fortress. When they heard
of the execution, his army melted from him like a snowdrift. The
confederacy of the chiefs was broken up;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
first one fell away from it, and
then another; and before the summer had come, O'Brien of Inchiquin,
O'Connor, who had married Fitzgerald's sister, and the few scattered
banditti of the Wicklow mountains, were all who remained of the grand
association which was to place the Island of Saints at the feet of the
Father of Christendom.</p>

<p>Sadder history in the compass of the world's great chronicle there is none
than the history of the Irish: so courageous, yet so like cowards; so
interesting, yet so resolute to forfeit all honourable claims to interest.
In thinking of them, we can but shake our heads with Lord Chancellor
Audeley, when meditating on this rebellion, and repeat after him, "they be
a people of strange nature, and of much
inconstancy."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitzgerald retreats into Thomond, intending to sail
for Spain.<br /><br />
O'Brien persuades him to remain.</div>

<p>Lord Fitzgerald was now a fugitive, with a price upon his head. He
retreated into Thomond, intending to sail for Spain, and to attempt with
his own lips to work persuasion with the
emperor.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
There was an expectation, however, that the Spaniards might be already on their way: and
O'Brien persuaded him to remain, to prevent the complete disintegration of
his party. Sir James de la Hyde was therefore sent to Charles; and the
wretched young nobleman himself wandered from place to place, venturing,
while Skeffington still lay at Maynooth, into the neighbourhood of his
home, among his own people, yet unable to do more than evade the attempts
which were made to capture him. The life of the rebellion was gone from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fidelity of the people.</div>

<p>There was no danger that he would be betrayed. The Irish had many
faults&mdash;we may not refuse them credit for their virtues. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>ever
treacherous they were to their enemies, however inconstant in their
engagements, uncertain, untrue in ordinary obligations, they were without
rivals in the world in their passionate attachments among themselves; and
of all the chiefs who fell from Fitzgerald's banner, and hastened with
submission to the English deputy, there was perhaps not one who, though
steeped in the blood of a hundred murders, would not have been torn limb
from limb rather than have listened to a temptation to betray him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of Lord Leonard Grey. Fitzgerald writes to him with an
offer of surrender.</div>

<p>At length, after a narrow escape from a surprise, from which he rescued
himself only by the connivance of the Irish kerne who were with the party
sent to take him, the young earl, as he now called himself, weary of his
wandering life, and when no Spaniards came, seeing that his cause was for
the present hopeless offered to surrender. It was by this time August, and
Lord Leonard Grey, his father's brother-in-law, was present with the army.
To him he wrote from O'Connor's Castle, in King's County, apologizing for
what he had done, desiring pardon "for his life and lands," and begging his
kinsman to interest himself in his behalf. If he could obtain his
forgiveness, he promised to deserve it. If it was refused, he said that he
"must shift for himself the best that he could."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey suggests an interview.</div>

<p>In reply to this overture, Grey suggested an interview. The appointment of
so near a relative of the Kildare's to high office in Ireland had been
determined, we may be sure, by the Geraldine influence in the English
council. The marshal was personally acquainted with Fitzgerald, and it is
to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
observed that the latter in writing to him signed himself his
"loving friend." That Lord Leonard was anxious to save him does not admit
of a doubt; he had been his father's chief advocate with the king, and his
natural sympathy with the representative of an ancient and noble house was
strengthened by family connexion. He is not to be suspected, therefore, of
<span class="sidenote">August 18.<br /><br /><br />
Fitzgerald meets him,</span>
treachery, at least towards his kinsman. The interview was agreed upon, and
on the eighteenth of August, Grey, with Sir Rice Mansell, Chief Justice
Aylmer, Lord James Butler, and Sir William St. Loo, rode from Maynooth into
King's County, where, on the borders of the Bog of Allen, Fitzgerald met
them. Here he repeated the conditions upon which he was ready to surrender.
Lord Grey said that he had no authority to entertain such conditions; but
he encouraged the hope that an unconditional surrender would tell in his
favour, and he promised himself to accompany his prisoner to the king's
<span class="sidenote">And surrenders on a dubious promise of pardon.</span>
presence. Fitzgerald interpreting expressions confessedly intended "to
allure him to
yield,"<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
in the manner most favourable to himself, placed
himself in the hands of the marshal, and rode back with him to the camp.</p>

<p>The deputy wrote immediately to announce the capture. Either the terms on
which it had been effected had not been communicated to him, or he thought
it prudent to conceal them, for he informed Henry that the traitor had
yielded without conditions, either of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
pardon, life, lands, or goods, "but
only submitting to his Grace's
mercy."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
The truth, however, was soon<span class="sidenote">Embarrassment of the government.</span>
known; and it occasioned the gravest embarrassment. How far a government is
bound at any time to respect the unauthorized engagements of its
subordinates, is one of those intricate questions which cannot be
absolutely answered;<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
and it was still less easy to decide, where the
<span class="sidenote">If Fitzgerald was spared, the government of Ireland was
impossible.</span>
object of such engagements had run a career so infamous as Lord Thomas
Fitzgerald. No pirate who ever swung on a well-earned gallows had committed
darker crimes, and the king was called upon to grant a pardon in virtue of
certain unpermitted hopes which had been held out in his name. He had
resolved to forgive no more noble traitors in Ireland, and if the
archbishop's murder was passed over, he had no right to affect authority in
<span class="sidenote">Yet, were the English entitled to reap the benefit of his
capture?</span>
a country where he was so unable to exert it. On the other hand, the
capture of so considerable a person was of great importance; his escape
abroad, if he had desired to leave the country, could not have been
prevented; and while the government retained the benefit which they derived
from his surrender, their honour seemed to be involved in observing the
conditions, however made, by which it had been secured.</p>

<p>It is likely, though it is not certain, that Lord Leonard foresaw the
dilemma in which Henry would be placed, and hoped by means of it to secure
the escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
of his kinsman. His own ultimate treason throws a shadow on his
earlier loyalty; and his talent was fully equal to so ingenious a fraud. He
had placed the king in a position from which no escape was possible that
was not open to grave objection. To pardon so heavy an offender was to
violate the first duty of government, and to grant a general licence to
Irish criminality; to execute him was to throw a shadow indirectly on the
king's good faith, and lay his generals open to a charge of treachery.
Henry resolved to err on the side on which error was least injurious. The
<span class="sidenote">The Duke of Norfolk advises delay of punishment.</span>
difficulty was submitted to the Duke of Norfolk, as of most experience in
Irish matters. The duke advised that execution should be delayed; but added
significantly, "quod defertur non aufertur."&mdash;Pardon was not to be thought
of; the example would be
fatal.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Immediate punishment would injure the
credit of Lord Grey, and would give occasion for slander against the
council.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
The best course would be to keep "the traitor" in safe
prison, and execute him, should it seem good, at a future
time.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> This
<span class="sidenote">Fitzgerald is hanged the following year at Tyburn.</span>
advice was followed. Fitzgerald, with his uncles, who had all been
implicated in the insurrection, was committed to the Tower; and in the year
following they were hanged at Tyburn.</p>

<p>So ended the rebellion in Ireland; significant chiefly because it was the
first in which an outbreak against England assumed the features of a war of
religion, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> first which the pope was especially invited to bless, and
the Catholic powers, as such, to assist. The features of it, on a narrow
scale, were identical with those of the later risings. Fostered by the
hesitation of the home authorities, it commenced in bravado and murder; it
vanished before the first blows of substantial resistance. Yet the
suppression of the insurrection was attended by the usual Irish fatality:
mistake and incompleteness followed the proceedings from the beginning to
the end; and the consciousness remained that a wound so closed would not
heal, that the moral temper of the country remained unaffected, and that
the same evils would again germinate.</p>

result of accident, Irish lands descending to heiresses who married into
English families. In other instances, forfeited estates were granted by the
crown to English favourites. The receiving rents, however, even though by
unwilling absentees, was treated as a crime by Henry VIII.; and English
noblemen, to whom estates in Ireland had fallen, either by marriage or
descent, on which they were unable to reside, were expected to grant such
estates to other persons who were able to reside upon them, and willing.
The wording of the Act of Absentees, passed in 1536, is very remarkable.
"Forasmuch as it is notorious and manifest that this the king's land of
Ireland, heretofore being inhabited, and in due obedience and subjection
unto the king's most noble progenitors, hath principally grown unto ruin,
dissolution, rebellion, and decay, by occasion that great dominions, lands,
and possessions within the same, as well by the king's grants as by course
of inheritance and otherwise have descended to noblemen of the realm of
England, who having the same, demouring within the said realm of England
... taking the profits of their said lands and possessions for a season,
without provision making for any defence or keeping thereof in good order
... in their absence, and by their negligence have suffered the wild
Irishrie, being mortal and natural enemies to the Kings of England, to
enter and hold the same without resistance; the conquest and winning
whereof in the beginning not only cost the king's noble progenitors charges
inestimable, but also those to whom the land was given, then and many years
after abiding within the said land, nobly and valiantly defended the same,
and kept such tranquillity and good order, as the Kings of England had due
subjection of the inhabitants thereof, and the laws were obeyed ... and
after the gift or descent of the lands to the persons aforesaid, they and
their heirs absented themselves out of the said land of Ireland, not
pondering nor regarding the preservation thereof ... the King's Majesty

murderer and the friends of the party murdered, which prosecute the action,
that the malefactor shall give unto them or unto the child or wife of him
that is slain, a recompence which they call an Eriarch. By which vile law
of theirs many murders are made up and smothered. And this judge being, as

<br />
<span class="ind10">&nbsp;</span><span class="ind15">"April 28, 1529.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
"On arriving at the coast of Ireland we touched at a port belonging to the
King of England named Cork. Many of the Irish people came on board the
ship, and told me that the gentleman of the Earl of Desmond had just
returned from Spain with presents from the Emperor to the earl.
</p><p>
"Leaving Cork, we were driven by bad weather into another harbour called
Beran,[A] from whence I sent one of my servants to inform the earl of my
arrival. In four days the earl's answer came, telling me that I was
welcome, and that he was at a place called Dingle, where he hoped to see
me. He addressed his letter to me as 'Chaplain of our Sovereign Lord the
Emperor;' and this, I understand, is his usual mode of expression when
speaking of his Majesty. He had also sent to some of the other noblemen of
the country, with whom he proposed to form a league, to tell them of my
arrival.
<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">[A] Beerhaven, perhaps.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
"I set out again, and on the way five of the earl's people came to me to
say that their master had gone to a harbour a few miles off to capture some
French and English vessels there, and would be glad of my assistance. This
I declined, and the earl, I understand, was satisfied with my excuses.
</p><p>
"The day after, the 21st of April, we reached the said harbour of Dingle,
and were honourably received by the townspeople, and by a party of the
earl's attendants. About four o'clock the earl returned himself, attended
by fifty horse and as many halberdiers. He came at once to my quarters, and
asked after the welfare of 'our Lord the Emperor.' I replied that, by the
grace of God, his Majesty was well, and I had sent his commendations to his
lordship.
</p><p>
"We then dined; and afterwards the earl and his council repaired to my
chamber, where we presented him with his Majesty's letter. He read it and
his council read it. His Majesty, he said, referred him to me. I was
commissioned to make known his Majesty's pleasure to him. I at once
declared my instructions, first in English to the earl, and afterward in
Latin to his council; which I said were to this effect.
</p><p>
"'One Godfrey, a friend of their lord, had lately presented himself to the
Emperor with their lord's letter, in which their lord, after speaking of
the good-will and affection which he entertained towards the Emperor's
Majesty, had expressed a desire to enter into close alliance with his
Majesty, as friend to friend and enemy to enemy, declaring himself ready,
in all things and at all times, to obey his Majesty's commands.
</p><p>
"'Further, the said Godfrey had requested the Emperor to send a
confidential person to Ireland, to learn more particularly their lord's
intentions, and his resources and power; and further, to negotiate a treaty
and establish a firm and complete alliance. For these purposes the Emperor
commissioned myself. I was the bearer to them of his Majesty's thanks for
their proposals, and I said I was so far in my master's confidence that I
was assured their lord might expect all possible assistance at the
Emperor's hands.'
</p><p>
"When I had done, the earl spoke a few words to his council. He then took
off his cap, and said he thanked his Majesty for his gracious
condescension. He had addressed himself to his Majesty as to his sovereign
lord, to entreat his protection. His Majesty was placed in this world in
his high position, in order that no one prince might oppress or injure
another. He related his descent to me. He said that, between his family and
the English, there had ever existed a mortal enmity, and he explained the
cause to me.
</p><p>
"I replied that his Majesty never failed to support his allies and his
subjects, and should he claim assistance in that capacity, his Majesty
would help him as he helped all his other good friends. I advised the earl
to put in writing the words which he had used to me. He thought it would be
enough if I repeated them; but when I said the story was too long, and my
memory might not retain it with accuracy, he said he would do as I desired.
</p><p>
"We then spoke of the support for which he was looking, of his projects and
resources, and of the places in which he proposed to serve. He said he
wanted from his Majesty four large vessels, two hundred tons each, six
pinnaces well provided with artillery, and five hundred Flemings to work
them. I said at once and earnestly, that such a demand was out of all
reason, before he, on his part, had achieved something in his Majesty's
service. I remonstrated fully and largely, although, to avoid being
tedious, I omit the details. In the end his council were satisfied that he
must reduce his demands till his Majesty had more reason to know what was
to be expected from him, and he consented, as will be seen by his own
memoir.
</p><p>
"Of all men in the world the earl hates most deeply the Cardinal of York.
He told me he had been in alliance with France, and had a relation called
De Quindel, now with the French army in Italy. In future, he said he would
have no dealings with the French. As your Majesty's enemies, they were his
enemies.
</p><p>
"Your Majesty will be pleased to understand that there are in Ireland four
principal cities. The city of Dublin is the largest and richest in the
island, and neither in the town nor in the neighbourhood has the Earl of
Desmond land or subjects. The Earl of Kildare is sovereign in that
district, but that earl is a kinsman of the Earl of Desmond, and has
married his cousin.
</p><p>
"The Earl of Kildare, however, is at present a prisoner in the Tower of
London.
</p><p>
"Of the other three cities, one is called Waterford, the second Cork, the
third Limerick; and in all of these the Earl of Desmond has lordships and
vassals. He has dominions, also, among the wild tribes; he has lords and
knights on his estates who pay him tribute. He has some allies, but not so
many, by a great deal, as he has enemies.
</p><p>
"He has ten castles of his own, some of which are strong and well built,
especially one named Dungarvan, which the King has often attempted to take
without success.
</p><p>
"The earl himself is from thirty to forty years old, and is rather above
the middle height. He keeps better justice throughout his dominions than
any other chief in Ireland. Robbers and homicides find no mercy, and are
executed out of hand. His people are in high order and discipline. They are
armed with short bows and swords. The earl's guard are in a mail from neck
to heel, and carry halberds. He has also a number of horse, some of whom
know how to break a lance. They all ride admirably without saddle or
stirrup."
</p>

<hr class="mini" />

<p>
After the report of Gonzalvo Fernandez, Desmond himself continues in Latin.
</p><p>
"Hereunto be added informations addressed to the invincible and most sacred
C&aelig;sar, ever august, by the Earl of Desmond, Lord of Ogonyll and the
liberties of Kilcrygge.
</p><p>
"I, James Earl of Desmond, am of royal blood, and of the race of the
Conqueror who did lawfully subdue Britain, great and small, and did reduce
Scotland and Ireland under his yoke.
</p><p>
"The first cause of the enmity between myself and the King of England is in
ancient prophecy or prediction, believed by the English nation, and written
in their books and chronicles, that all England will be conquered by an
Earl of Desmond, which enterprise I have not yet undertaken.
</p><p>
"The second cause is that, through fear of this prophecy, the King of
England has committed his powers to my predecessors who have borne rule in
Ireland; and when Thomas Earl of Desmond, my grandfather, in peaceable
manner attended Parliament in Ireland, no cause being alleged against him,
but merely in dread of the prophecy, they struck off his head.
</p><p>
"The third cause is that, when Richard, son of the King of England [<i>sic</i>],
heard that there were ancient feuds between the English and my
predecessors, he came to Ireland with an army and a great fleet in the time
of my father; and then did my father make all Ireland to be subdued unto
himself, some few towns only excepted.
</p><p>
"The fourth cause is that, by reason of the aforesaid feuds, the King of
England did cause Gerald Earl of Kildare, my father's kinsman, to be
destroyed in prison [<i>destrui in carceribus</i>] until that my father, by
might and power, did liberate the said Earl of Kildare, and did obtain his
own purposes, and did make his kinsman viceroy of Ireland.
</p><p>
"The fifth cause is that, when peace was hardly begun between my aforesaid
father and the King of England, a certain sickness fell upon my father, I
myself being then eight years old.
</p><p>
"The King, when he heard this, made a league of Irish and English to kill
my father; he being then, as they thought, unable to take the field. They,
being banded together, made war against my father for twenty-four years,
wherein, by God's grace, they had small success.
</p><p>
"The sixth cause is that, when peace was made at last between the King that
now is and myself, I, in faith of the said peace, sent certain of my
servants to the parts beyond the seas to Flanders and France, and the
attorneys of the King of England did despoil my servants of the sum of
9000l., and threw them into prison, where they now remain.
</p><p>
"Hereon follows my supplication:&mdash;
</p><p>
"These things premised, I, the aforesaid earl, do implore and entreat the
invincible and most sacred Majesty of C&aelig;sar Augustus that he will deign to
provide me with remedy, and I, with all my horses and people, do devote
myself to your Majesty's service, seeing that your Majesty is appointed for
the welfare of the oppressed, and to be lord paramount of all the earth.
</p><p>
"To revenge the injuries done to myself and my family by the King of
England, I have the following powers; that is to say, 16,500 foot and 1500
horse. Also I have friends, confederate with me, whose names be these&mdash;

"Finally, divine grace permitting, I intend to gather together my own and
my friends' powers, and lead them in person against Piers Butler, deputy of
the King of England, and against Limerick, Wexford, and Dublin, the cities

"For the aid for which I look from your Majesty, I desire especially cannon

your Majesty, therefore, to send me cannon, that I may be the better able

day, report is made by the Vicar of Dungarvan, that the emperour hath sent
certain letters unto the Earl of Desmond, by the same chaplain or
ambassador that was sent to James the late earl. And the common bruit is,
that his practice is to win the Geraltynes and the Breenes; and that the
emperour intendeth shortly to send an army to invade the cities and towns
by the sea coasts of this land. This thing was spoken by a Spaniard more
than a month agone to one of the inhabitants of this city; and because I
thought it then somewhat incredible, I forbare at that time to write unto
your wisdom thereof. The chaplain arrived more than fifteen days past at
the Dingle, in the dominion of the said Earl, which Earl hath, for the
victualling of his castle of Dungarvan, taken a ship charged with Spanish
wines, that was bound to the town of Galway; and albeit that his years

"To the most sacred and most invincible C&aelig;sar, Charles Emperor of the
Romans, Most Catholic King of Spain, health with all submission.&mdash;Most
sacred C&aelig;sar, lord most clement, we give your Majesty to know that our
predecessors for a long time quietly and peacefully occupied Ireland, with
constancy, force, and courage, and without rebellion. They possessed and
governed this country in manner royal, as by our ancient chronicles doth
plainly appear. Our said predecessors and ancestry did come from your
Majesty's realm of Spain, where they were of the blood of a Spanish prince,
and many Kings of that lineage, in long succession, governed all Ireland
happily, until it was conquered by the English. The last King of this land
was of my blood and name; and ever since that time our ancestors, and we
ourselves, have ceased not to oppose the English intruders; we have never
been subject to English rule, or yielded up our ancient rights and
liberties; and there is at this present, and for ever will be, perpetual
discord between us, and we will harass them with continual war.
</p><p>
"For this cause, we, who till this present, have sworn fealty to no man,
submit ourselves, our lands, our families, our followers, to the protection
and defence of your Majesty, and of free will and deliberate purpose we
promise to obey your Majesty's orders and commands in all honest behests.
We will serve your Majesty with all our force; that is to say, with 1660
horse and 2440 foot, equipped and armed. Further, we will levy and direct
for your Majesty's use 13,000 men, well armed with harquebuss, bows,
arrows, and swords. We will submit to your Majesty's will and jurisdiction
more than a hundred castles, and they and all else shall be at your
Majesty's disposition to be employed as you shall direct.
</p><p>
"We can undertake also for the assistance and support of our good brother
the Earl of Desmond, whose cousin, the daughter of the late Earl James,
your Majesty's friend, is our wife.
</p><p>
"Our further pleasure will be declared to you by our servants and friends,
Robert and Dominic de Paul, to whom your Majesty will deign to give
credence. May your Majesty be ever prosperous.

things to Henry. He mentions having set a party on shore, but says nothing
of their having been destroyed; and he could not have been ignorant of
their fate, for he was writing three weeks after it, from Dublin. He was
silent, too, of the injury which he had received from the pirates, though
eloquent on the boats which he burnt at the Skerries.&mdash;<i>State Papers</i>, Vol.

the "brilliant victory" claimed by the Irish historians (see Leland, Vol.
II. p. 148) must have been imaginary. The Irish Statute Book, however, is
too explicit to allow of such a hope. "He [Fitzgerald] not only fortified
and manned divers ships at sea, for keeping and letting, destroying and
taking the king's deputy, army, and subjects, that they should not land
within the said land; but also at the arrival of the said army, the same
Thomas, accompanied with his uncles, servants, adherents, &amp;c., falsely and
traitorously assembled themselves together upon the sea coast, for keeping

the power of artillery. Sebastiani mentions experiments on the range of
guns which were made by him, in Southampton water; and it is likely that
the cannon used in the siege of Maynooth were the large-sized brass guns
which were first cast in England in the year of its capture.&mdash;Stow, p. 572.
When the history of artillery is written, Henry VIII.'s labours in this
department must not be forgotten. Two foreign engineers whom he tempted
into his service, first invented "shells." "One Peter Baud, a Frenchman
born," says Stow, "and another alien, called Peter Van Collen, a gunsmith,
both the king's feed men, conferring together, devised and caused to be
made certain mortar pieces, being at the mouth from eleven inches unto
nineteen inches wide, for the use whereof they [also] caused to be made
certain hollow shot of cast iron, to be stuffed with fire-work or wildfire;
whereof the bigger sort for the same had screws of iron to receive a match
to carry fire kindled, that the firework might be set on fire for to break
in pieces the same hollow shot, whereof the smallest piece hitting any man
would kill or spoil him."&mdash;Stow, <i>Chronicle</i>, p. 584.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="chaptsubhead">THE CATHOLIC MARTYRS.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of England in the summer of 1534.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">While</span> the disturbance in Ireland was at its height, affairs in England had
been scarcely less critical. The surface indeed remained unbroken. The
summer of 1534 passed away, and the threatened invasion had not taken
place. The disaffection which had appeared in the preceding year had been
smothered for a time; Francis I. held the emperor in check by menacing
Flanders, and through French influence the rupture with Scotland had been
seemingly healed. In appearance the excommunication had passed off as a
<i>brutum fulmen</i>, a flash of harmless sheet lightning, serving only to
dazzle feeble eyes. The oath of succession, too, had been taken generally
through the country; Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher having alone
ventured to refuse. The pope had been abjured by the universities and by
the convocation in both the provinces, and to these collective acts the
bishops and the higher clergy had added each their separate consent.</p>

<p>But the government knew too well the temper of the clergy to trust to
outward compliance, or to feel assured that they acquiesced at heart either
in the separation from Rome, or in the loss of their treasured privileges.
The theory of an Anglican Erastianism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
found favour with some of the higher
<span class="sidenote">The clergy comply with the revolution, but inwardly have little
heart for it.</span>
church dignitaries, and with a section perhaps of secular priests; but the
transfer to the crown of the first-fruits, which in their original zeal for
a free Church of England the ecclesiastics had hoped to preserve for
themselves, the abrupt limitation of the powers of convocation, and the
termination of so many time-honoured and lucrative abuses, had interfered
with the popularity of a view which might have been otherwise broadly
welcomed; and while growing vigorously among the country gentlemen and the
middle classes in the towns, among the clergy it throve only within the
sunshine of the court. The rest were overawed for the moment, and stunned
by the suddenness of the blows which had fallen upon them. As far as they
thought at all, they believed that the storm would be but of brief
duration, that it would pass away as it had risen, and that for the moment
they had only to bend. The modern Englishman looks back upon the time with
the light of after history. He has been inured by three centuries of
division to the spectacle of a divided church, and sees nothing in it
either embarrassing or fearful. The ministers of a faith which had been for
fifteen centuries as the seamless vesture of Christ, the priests of a
church supposed to be founded on the everlasting rock against which no
power could prevail, were in a very different position. They obeyed for the
time the strong hand which was upon them, trusting to the interference of
accident or providence. They comforted themselves with the hope that the
<span class="sidenote">They bend before the storm, trusting to time.</span>
world would speedily fall back into its old ways, that Christ and the
saints would defend the church against sacrilege, and that in the meantime
there was no occasion for them to thrust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
themselves upon voluntary
martyrdom.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
But this position, natural as it was, became difficult to
maintain when they were called upon not only themselves to consent to the
changes, but to justify their consent to their congregations, and to
explain to the people the grounds on which the government had acted. The
kingdom was by implication under an
interdict,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
yet the services went
on as usual; the king was excommunicated; doubt hung over the succession;
the facts were imperfectly known; and the never-resting friars mendicant
were busy scattering falsehood and misrepresentation. It was of the highest
moment that on all these important matters the mind of the nation should if
possible be set at rest; and the clergy, whose loyalty was presumed rather
<span class="sidenote">The clergy are called upon to explain to the people the changes
which have taken place.</span>
than trusted, furnished the only means by which the government could
generally and simultaneously reach the people. The clergy therefore, as we
have seen, were called upon for their services; the pope's name was erased
from the mass; books; the statute of appeals and the statute of succession
were fixed against the doors of every parish church in England, and the
rectors and curates were directed every week in their sermons to explain
the meaning of these acts. The bishops were held responsible for the
obedience of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
clergy; the sheriffs and the magistrates had been
directed to keep an eye upon the bishops; and all the machinery of
centralization was put in force to compel the fulfilment of a duty which
was well known to be unwelcome.</p>

<p>That as little latitude as possible might be left for resistance or
evasion, books were printed by order of council, and distributed through
the hands of the bishops, containing a minute account of the whole
proceedings on the divorce, the promises and falsehoods of the pope, the
opinions of the European universities, and a general epitome of the course
which had been<span class="sidenote">The order for preaching. Every preacher to deliver one sermon
against the papal usurpation.</span>
pursued.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
These were to be read aloud to the
congregations; and an order for preaching was at the same time circulated,
in which the minuteness of the directions is as remarkable as the prudence
of them. Every preacher was to deliver one sermon at least ("and after at
his liberty") on the encroachments and usurpations of the papal power. He
was to preach against it, to expose and refute it to the best of his
ability, and to declare that it was done away, and might neither be obeyed
nor defended further. Again in all places "where the king's just cause in
<span class="sidenote">The archbishop's sentence to be held a thing of mere verity, not
to be again called in question.</span>
his matter of matrimony had been detracted, and the incestuous and unjust
[matrimony] had been set forth [and extolled]," the clergy were generally
directed "to open and declare the mere verity and justice" of the matter,
declaring it "neither doubtful nor disputable," but to be a thing of mere
verity, and so to be allowed of all men's opinions. They were to relate in
detail the pope's conduct, his many declarations in the king's favour; the
first decretal, which was withheld
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
by Campeggio, in which he had
pronounced the marriage with Catherine invalid; his unjust avocation of the
cause to Rome; his promises to the King of France; and finally, his
engagement at Marseilles to pronounce in the King of England's favour, if
only he would acknowledge the papal
jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
They were therefore
to represent the king's conduct as the just and necessary result of the
pope's duplicity. These things the clergy were required to teach, not as
matters of doubt and question, but as vital certainties on which no
<span class="sidenote">The clergy are forbidden to preach upon disputed points of
doctrine.</span>
difference of opinion could be tolerated. Finally, there were added a few
wholesome admonitions on other subjects, which mark the turning of the tide
from Catholic orthodoxy. The clergy were interdicted from indulging any
longer in the polemics of theology. "To keep unity and quietness in the
realm it" was "ordained that no preachers" should "contend openly in the
pulpit one against another, nor uncharitably deprave one another in open
audience. If any of them" were "grieved one with another," they were to
"complain to the King's Highness or the archbishop or bishop of the
diocese." They were "purely, sincerely, and justly" to "preach the
scripture and words of Christ, and not mix them with men's institutions, or
make men believe that the force of God's law and man's law was the like."
On subjects such as purgatory, worship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
of saints and relics, marriage of
the clergy, justification by faith, pilgrimages and miracles, they were to
keep silence for one whole year, and not to preach at
all.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>These instructions express distinctly the convictions of the government. It
would have been well if the clergy could have accepted them as they were
given, and submitted their understandings once for all to statesmen who
were wiser than themselves. The majority (of the parish clergy at least)
were perhaps outwardly obedient; but the surveillance which the magistrates
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty of securing obedience to the order. Obstructiveness
of the bishops,</span>
were directed to exercise proves that the exceptions were expected to be
extensive; and in many quarters these precautions themselves were rapidly
discovered to be inadequate. Several even of the most trusted among the
bishops attempted an obstructive resistance. The clergy of the north were
notoriously disobedient. The Archbishop of York was reported to have talked
loosely of "standing against" the king "unto
death."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
The Bishop of
Durham fell under suspicion, and was summoned to London. His palace was
searched and his papers examined in his absence; and the result, though
inconclusive, was
unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
The religious orders again
(especially the monks of such houses as had been implicated with the Nun of
<span class="sidenote">And of the regular clergy.</span>
Kent) were openly recusant. At the convent at Sion, near Richmond, a
certain Father Ricot preached as he was commanded, "but he made this
addition, that he which commanded him to preach should discharge his
conscience: and as soon," it was said, "as the said Ricot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
began to declare
the king's title," "nine of the brethren departed from the sermon, contrary
to the rule of their religion, to the great slander of the
audience."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Indeed it soon became evident that among the regular clergy no compliance
whatever was to be looked for; and the agents of the government began to
contemplate the possible consequences, with a tenderness not indeed for the
prospective sufferers, but for the authorities whom they would so cruelly
compel to punish them. "I am right sorry," wrote Cromwell's secretary to
him, "to see the foolishness and obstinacy of divers religious men, so
addict to the Bishop of Rome and his usurped power, that they contemn
counsel as careless men and willing to die. If it were not for the opinion
which men had, and some yet have, in their apparent holiness, it made no
great matter what became of them, so their souls were saved. And for my
part, I would that all such obstinate persons of them as be ready to die
for the advancement of the Bishop of Rome's authority were dead indeed by
God's hand, that no man should run wrongfully into obloquy for their just
punishment."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Powers of the confessional.</div>

<p>But the open resistance of mistaken honesty was not the danger which the
government most feared. Another peril threatened their authority, deeper
and more alarming by far. The clergy possessed in the confessional a power
of secret influence over the masses of the people, by which they were able
at once (if they so pleased) to grant their penitents licences for
insincerity, to permit them to perjure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
themselves under mental
<span class="sidenote">The clergy in some cases advise their penitents to take the
oaths with a mental reservation.</span>
reservations, and to encourage them to expiate a venial falsehood by
concealed disaffection. The secrets of confession were inviolable.
Anathemas the most fearful forbade their disclosure; and, secured behind
this impenetrable shield, the church might defy the most stringent
provisions, and baffle every precaution.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case but little could transpire of the use or the
abuse which was made at such a time of so vast a power; but Cromwell, whose
especial gift it was to wind himself into the secrets of the clergy, had
his sleuth-hounds abroad, whose scent was not easily baffled. The long
tyranny of the priesthood produced also its natural retribution in the
informations which were too gladly volunteered in the hour of revenge; and
more than one singular disclosure remains among the <i>State Papers</i>, of
language used in this mysterious intercourse. Every man who doubted whether
he might lawfully abjure the pope, consulted his priest. Haughton, the
Prior of Charterhouse, in all such cases, declared absolutely that the
abjuration might not be made.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> He himself refused openly; and it is
likely that he directed others to be as open as himself. But Haughton's
advice was as exceptional as his conduct. Father Forest, of Greenwich, who
was a brave man, and afterwards met nobly a cruel death, took the oath to
the king as he was required; while he told a penitent that he had abjured
the pope in the outward, but not in the inward man, that he "owed an
obedience to the pope which he could not shake off," and that it was "his
use and practice in confes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>sion, to induce men to hold and stick to the old
fashion of belief."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Confession of John Staunton.</div>

<p>Here, again, is a conversation which a treacherous penitent revealed to
Cromwell; the persons in the dialogue being the informer, John Staunton,
and the confessor of Sion Monastery, who had professed the most excessive
loyalty to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The informer, it must be allowed, was a
good-for-nothing person. He had gone to the confessor, he said, to be
shriven, and had commenced his confession with acknowledging "the seven
deadly sins particularly," "and next the misspending of his five wits." As
an instance of the latter, he then in detail had confessed to heresy; he
could not persuade himself that the priest had power to forgive him. "Sir,"
he professed to have said to the confessor, "there is one thing in my
stomach which grieveth my conscience very sore; and that is by reason of a
sermon I heard yesterday of Master Latimer, saying that no man of himself
had authority to forgive sins, and that the pope had no more authority than
another bishop; and therefore I am in doubt whether I shall have remission
of my sins of you or not, and that the pardon is of no effect."</p>

<p>The priest answered, "That Latimer is a false knave;" and seven or eight
times he called him false knave, and said he was an eretycke. "Marry, this
I heard Latimer say," the confessor continued, "that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> if a man come to
confession, and be not sorry for his sins, the priest hath no power to
forgive him. I say the pope's pardon is as good as ever it was; and he is
the Head of the Universal Church, and so I will take him. Here in England
the king and his parliament hath put him out; but be of good comfort, and
steadfast in your faith; this thing will not last long, I warrant you. You
shall see the world change shortly."</p>

<p>To this the informer said that he had replied, "You know how that we be
sworn unto the King's Grace, and he hath already abjured the pope."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The confessor thinks that an oath loosely made may be loosely
broken.</div>

<p>"As for that," said the priest, "an oath loosely made may be loosely
broken; and by this example be ye in ease. I had an enemy come unto this
church, and one of his friends and mine came unto me and said, 'Sir, I pray
you let us go drink with yonder man.' And the said friend maketh such
importunate suit unto me to drink with my enemy, that I promise him by my
faith that I will go and drink with him; and so indeed doth drink with him.
But what then," said the priest; "though I go and drink with him upon this
promise, trow you that I will forgive him with my heart. Nay, nay, I
warrant you. And so in like wise in this oath concerning the abjuration of
the pope. I will not abjure him in my heart," said the priest, "for these
<span class="sidenote">Reported advice of Cranmer to the confessor of Sion.</span>
words were not spoken unto Peter for nought&mdash;'I will give thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven'&mdash;and the pope is Peter's successor. Of this matter,"
said the priest, "I communed once with the Bishop of
Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and I
told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the bishop I would pray for the pope as the chief and papal head of
Christ's church. And the bishop told me it was the king's pleasure that I
should not. I said unto him I would do it; and though I did it not openly,
yet would I do it secretly. And he said I might pray for him secretly, but
in any wise do it not
openly."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Trifles of this kind may seem unimportant; but at the time they were of
moment, for their weight was cumulative; and we can only now recover but a
few out of many. Such as they are, however, they show the spirit in which
the injunctions were received by a section at least of the English clergy.
Nor was this the worst. We find language reported, which shows that many
<span class="sidenote">Maitland the Black Friar, by his science of nigromancy,

among the monks were watching for symptoms of the promised imperial
invasion, and the progress of the Irish insurgents. A Doctor Maitland, of
the order of Black Friars in London, had been "heard divers times to say,
he trusted to see every man's head that was of the new learning, and the
maintainers of them, to stand upon a stake, and Cranmer's to be one of
them. The king," he hoped, might suffer "a violent and shameful death;" and
"the queen, that mischievous whore, might be brent." "He said further, that
he knew by his science, which was nigromancy, that all men of the new
learning should be suppressed and suffer death, and the <i>people of the old
learning should be set up again by the power of the king's enemies from the
parts beyond the sea</i>."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Feron and Hale.</div>

<p>In the May weather of 1534, two Middlesex clergy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
"walking to and fro in
the cloyster garden at Sion, were there overheard compassing sedition and
rebellion." John Hale, an eager, tumultuous person, was prompting his
brother priest, Robert Feron, with matter for a pamphlet, which Feron was
to write against the
king.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
"Syth the realm of England was first a
realm," said Hale, "was there never in it so great a robber and piller of

death, I beseech God, may be like to the death of the most wicked John,
sometime king of this realm, or rather to be called a great tyran than a

<p>These words were spoken in English; Feron translated them into Latin, and
wrote them down. Hale then continued: "Until the king and the rulers of
this realm be plucked by the pates, and brought, as we say, to the pot,
shall we never live merrily in England, which, I pray God, may chance, and
now shortly come to pass. Ireland is set against him, which will never

For of truth, they go about to bring this realm into such miserable
condition as is France; which the commons see, <i>and perceive well enough a

<div class="sidenote">The persecuting laws against the Catholics.</div>

<p>These informations may assist us in understanding, if we cannot forgive,
the severe enactments&mdash;severely to be executed&mdash;which were passed in the
ensuing parliament.</p>

<p>It is a maxim of sound policy, that actions only are a proper subject of
punishment,&mdash;that to treat men as offenders for their words, their
intentions, or their opinions, is not justice, but tyranny. But there is no
rule which is universally applicable. The policy of a state of war is not
the policy of a state of peace. And as a soldier in a campaign is not at
liberty to criticise openly the cause for which he is fighting; as no
general, on his army going into action, can permit a subordinate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>to
decline from his duty in the moment of danger, on the plea that he is
dissatisfied with the grounds of the quarrel, and that his conscience
forbids him to take part in it; so there are times when whole nations are
in a position analogous to that of an army so circumstanced; when the
safety of the State depends upon unity of purpose, and when private persons
<span class="sidenote">Effect of circumstances upon policy.</span>
must be compelled to reserve their opinions to themselves; when they must
be compelled neither to express them in words, nor to act upon them in
their capacity of citizens, except at their utmost peril. At such times the
<i>salus populi</i> overrides all other considerations; and the maxims and laws
of calmer periods for awhile consent to be suspended. The circumstances of
<span class="sidenote">A modern analogy.</span>
the year 1848 will enable us, if we reflect, not upon what those
circumstances actually were, but on what they easily might have been, to
understand the position of Henry VIII.'s government at the moment of the
separation from Rome. If the danger in 1848 had ceased to be imaginary,&mdash;if
Ireland had broken into a real insurrection,&mdash;if half the population of
England had been Socialist, and had been in secret league with the leaders
of the Revolution in Paris for a combined attack upon the State by
insurrection and invasion,&mdash;the mere passing of a law, making the use of
seditious language an act of treason, would not have been adequate to the
danger. Influential persons would have been justly submitted to question on
their allegiance, and insufficient answers would have been interpreted as
justifying suspicion. Not the expression only, of opinions subversive of
society, but the holding such opinions, however discovered, would have been
regarded and treated as a crime, with the full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
consent of what is called
the common sense and educated judgment of the
nation.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>If for "opinions subversive of society," we substitute allegiance to the
papacy, the parallel is complete between the year 1848, as it would then
have been, and the time when the penal laws which are considered the
reproach of the Tudor governments were passed against the Roman Catholics.
I assume that the Reformation was in itself right; that the claims of the
pope to an English supremacy were unjust; and that it was good and wise to
resist those claims. If this be allowed, those laws will not be found to
deserve the reproach of tyranny. We shall see in them but the natural
<span class="sidenote">The Romanism of the sixteenth century not the Romanism of the
nineteenth.</span>
resource of a vigorous government placed in circumstances of extreme peril.
The Romanism of the present day is a harmless opinion, no more productive
of evil than any other superstition, and without tendency, or shadow of
tendency, to impair the allegiance of those who profess it. But we must not
confound a phantom with a substance; or gather from modern experience the
temper of a time when words implied realities, when Catholics really
believed that they owed no allegiance to an heretical sovereign, and that
the first duty of their lives was to a foreign potentate. This perilous
doctrine was waning, indeed, but it was not dead. By many it was actively
professed; and among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> those by whom it was denied there were few except the
Protestants whom it did not in some degree embarrass and perplex.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Parliament meets, November 3.<br /><br />
The king is declared supreme Head of the Church.</div>

<p>The government, therefore, in the close of 1534, having clear evidence
before them of intended treason, determined to put it down with a high
hand; and with this purpose parliament met again on the 3d of November. The
first act of the session was to give the sanction of the legislature to the
title which had been conceded by convocation, and to declare the king
supreme Head of the Church of England. As affirmed by the legislature, this
designation meant something more than when it was granted three years
previously by the clergy. It then implied that the spiritual body were no
longer to be an <i>imperium in imperio</i> within the realm, but should hold
their powers subordinate to the crown. It was now an assertion of
independence of foreign jurisdiction; it was the complement of the Act of
Appeals, rounding off into completeness the constitution in Church and
State of the English nation. The act is short, and being of so great
importance, I insert it entire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Act of Supremacy.</div>

<p>"Albeit," it runs, "the King's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought
to be the supreme Head of the Church of England, and so is recognised by
the clergy of this realm in their convocation, yet nevertheless, for
corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in
Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirp
all errours, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in
the same: Be it enacted, by authority of this present parliament, that the
King our Sovereign Lord, his heirs and successors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> kings of this realm,
shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme Head in earth of the
Church of England, called <i>Anglicana Ecclesia</i>, and shall have and enjoy,
annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title
and style thereof as all the honours, dignities, pre-eminences,
jurisdictions, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities, to the
said dignity belonging and appertaining; and that our said Sovereign Lord,
his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and
authority to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain, and
amend all such errours, heresies, abuses, contempts, and enormities,
whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or
jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed&mdash;most to the pleasure of
Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the
conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquillity of this realm&mdash;any
usage, custom, foreign lawes, foreign authority, prescription, or any other
thing or things to the contrary hereof
notwithstanding."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />The meaning and value of the title.
<br /><br />It becomes the gage of the battle.</div>

<p>Considerable sarcasm has been levelled at the assumption by Henry of this
title; and on the accession of Elizabeth, the crown, while reclaiming the
authority, thought it prudent to retire from the designation. Yet it
answered a purpose in marking the nature of the revolution, and the
emphasis of the name carried home the change into the mind of the country.
It was the epitome of all the measures which had been passed against the
encroachments of the spiritual powers within and without the realm; it was
at once the symbol of the independence of England, and the declaration that
thenceforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the civil magistrate was supreme within the English dominions
over church as well as
state.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Whether the king was or was not head of the church, became now therefore
the rallying point of the struggle; and the denial or acceptance of his
title the test of allegiance or disloyalty. To accept it was to go along
with the movement heartily and completely; to deny it was to admit the
rival sovereignty of the pope, and with his sovereignty the lawfulness of
the sentence of excommunication. It was to imply that Henry was not only
not head of the church, but that he was no longer lawful King of England,
and that the allegiance of the country must be transferred to the Princess
Mary when the pope and the emperor should give the word. There might be no
intention of treason; the motive of the opposition might be purely
religious; but from the nature of the case opposition of any kind would
abet the treason of others; and no honesty of meaning could render possible
any longer a double loyalty to the crown and to the papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new Treason Act.</div>

<p>The act conferring the title was in consequence followed by another,
declaring the denial of it to be treason. It was necessary to stop the
tongues of the noisy mutinous monks, to show them once for all that these
high matters were no subjects for trifling. The oath to the succession of
the Princess Elizabeth partially answered this purpose; and the obligation
to take that oath had been extended to all classes of the king's
subjects;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> but to refuse to swear to the succession was misprision of
treason only, not high treason; and the ecclesiastics (it had been seen)
found no difficulty in swearing oaths which they did not mean to observe.
The parliament therefore now attached to the statute of supremacy the
following imperious corollary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">For the better security of the realm, it is enacted, That any
person who, by words, writing, or otherwise, deprives the king or queen of
any one of their just titles, shall be held guilty of high treason.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
"Forasmuch as it is most necessary, both for common policy and duty of
subjects, above all things to prohibit, provide, restrain, and extinct all
manner of shameful slanders, perils, or imminent danger or dangers, which
might grow, happen, or arise to their sovereign lord the king, the queen,
or their heirs, which, when they be heard, seen, or understood, cannot be
but odible and also abhorred of all those sorts that be true and loving
subjects, if in any point they may, do, or shall touch the king, the queen,
their heirs or successors, upon which dependeth the whole unity and
universal weal of this realm; without providing wherefore, too great a
scope should be given to all cankered and traitorous hearts, willers and
workers of the same; and also the king's loving subjects should not declare
unto their sovereign lord now being, which unto them both hath been and is
most entirely beloved and esteemed, their undoubted sincerity and truth: Be
it therefore enacted, that if any person or persons, after the first day of
February next coming, do maliciously wish, will, or desire, by words or
writing, or by craft imagine, invent, practise, or attempt any bodily harm
to be done or committed to the king's most royal person, the queen's, or
their heirs apparent, or to <i>deprive them or any of them of the dignity,
title, or name of their royal estates</i>, or slanderously and maliciously
publish and pronounce by express writing or words that the king our
sovereign lord should be heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper
of the crown, &amp;c., &amp;c., that all such persons, their aiders, counsellors,
concertors, or abettors, being thereof lawfully convict according to the
laws and customs of the realm, shall be adjudged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
traitors, and that every
such offence in any of the premises shall be adjudged high
treason."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The act made still more comprehensive, in the interpretation of
it.</div>

<p>The terrible powers which were thus committed to the government lie on the
surface of this language; but comprehensive as the statute appears, it was
still further extended by the interpretation of the lawyers. In order to
fall under its penalties it was held not to be necessary that positive
guilt should be proved in any one of the specified offences; it was enough
if a man refused to give satisfactory answers when subjected to official
examination.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
At the discretion of the king or his ministers the active
consent to the supremacy might be required of any person on whom they
pleased to call, under penalty to the recusant of the dreadful death of a
traitor. So extreme a measure can only be regarded as a remedy for an evil
which was also extreme; and as on the return of quiet times the parliament
made haste to repeal a law which was no longer required, so in the
enactment of that law we are bound to believe that they were not betraying
English liberties in a spirit of careless complacency; but that they
believed truly that the security of the state required unusual precautions.
The nation was standing with its sword half drawn in the face of an armed
Europe, and it was no time to permit dissensions in the
camp.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>

and although we may regret that in this grand struggle for freedom, success
could only be won by the aid of measures which bordered upon oppression,
yet here also the even hand of justice was but commending the chalice to
the lips of those who had made others drink it to the dregs. They only were
likely to fall under the Treason Act who for centuries had fed the rack and
the stake with sufferers for "opinion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment of suffragan bishops.</div>

<p>Having thus made provision for public safety, the parliament voted a supply
of money for the fortifications on the coast and for the expenses of the
Irish war; and after transferring to the crown the first-fruits of church
benefices, which had been previously paid to the See of Rome, and passing
at the same time a large and liberal measure for the appointment of
twenty-six suffragan bishops,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> they separated, not to meet again for
more than a year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal Farnese is chosen pope.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, at Rome a change had taken place which for the moment seemed to
promise that the storm after all might pass away. The conclave had elected
as a successor to Clement a man who,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of all the Italian ecclesiastics, was
the most likely to recompose the quarrels in the church; and who, if the
genius or the destiny of the papacy had not been too strong for any
individual will, would perhaps have succeeded in restoring peace to
Christendom. In the debates upon the divorce the Cardinal Farnese had been
steadily upon Henry's side. He had maintained from the first the general
justice of the king's demands. After the final sentence was passed, he had
urged, though vainly, the reconsideration of that fatal step; and though
slow and cautious, although he was a person who, as Sir Gregory Cassalis
described him, "would accomplish little, but would make few
mistakes,"<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
he had allowed his opinion upon this, as on other matters connected with
the English quarrel, to be generally known. He was elected therefore by
<span class="sidenote">He is chosen by French influence, in the hope he will pursue a
liberal and conciliating policy.</span>
French influence<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
as the person most likely to meet the difficulties of
Europe in a catholic and conciliating spirit. He had announced his
intention, immediately on Clement's death, of calling a general council at
the earliest moment, in the event of his being chosen to fill the papal
chair; and as he was the friend rather of Francis I. than of the emperor,
and as Francis was actively supporting Henry, and was negotiating at the
same moment with the Protestant princes in Germany, it seemed as if a
council summoned under such auspices would endeavour to compose the general
discords in a temper of wise liberality, and that some terms of compromise
would be discovered where by mutual concessions Catholic and Protestant
might meet upon a common ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
The moment was propitious for such a hope; for the accession of a moderate
pope coincided with the reaction in Germany which followed the scandals at
Munster and the excesses of John of Leyden; and Francis pictured to himself
a coalition between France, England, and the Lutherans, which, if the
papacy was attached to their side, would be strong enough to bear down
opposition, and reconstitute the churches of Europe upon the basis of
liberality which he seemed to have secured for the church of France. The
flattering vision in the autumn of the following year dazzled the German
princes. Perhaps in the novelty of hope it was encouraged even by the pope,
before he had felt the strong hand of fate which ruled his will.</p>

<p>To Charles V. the danger of some such termination of the great question at
issue appeared most near and real. Charles, whose resentment at the conduct
<span class="sidenote">Anxiety and alarm of the emperor.</span>
of England united with a desire to assert his authority over his subjects
in Germany, beheld with the utmost alarm a scheme growing to maturity which
menaced alike his honour, his desire of revenge, his supremacy in Europe,
and perhaps his religious convictions. A liberal coalition would be fatal
<span class="sidenote">The mission of the Count of Nassau to Paris with proposals for a
league.</span>
to order, to policy, to truth; and on the election of Cardinal Farnese, the
Count de Nassau was sent on a secret mission to Paris with overtures, the
elaborate condescension of which betrays the anxiety that must have
dictated them. The emperor, in his self-constituted capacity of the
Princess Mary's guardian, offered her hand with the English succession to
the Duke of Angoulesme. From the terms on which he was thought to stand
with Anne Boleyn, it was thought possible that Henry might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
consent;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
he might not dare, as d'Inteville before suggested, to oppose the united
demands of France and the
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
To Margaret de Valois the Count was
to propose the splendid temptation of a marriage with
Philip.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> If
Francis would surrender the English alliance, the emperor would make over
to him the passionately coveted Duchy of
Milan,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
to be annexed to
France on the death of the reigning Duke. In the meantime
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
he would pay to
the French king, as "tribute for Milan," a hundred thousand crowns a year,
as an acknowledgment of the right of the house of Valois. Offers such as
these might well have tempted the light ambition of Francis. If sincere,
they were equivalent to a surrender of the prize for which the emperor's
life had been spent in contending, and perilous indeed it would have been
for England if this intrigue had been permitted to succeed. But whether it
was that Francis too deeply distrusted Charles, that he preferred the more
<span class="sidenote">The emperor's offers are rejected by Francis.</span>
hazardous scheme of the German alliance, or that he supposed he could gain
his object more surely with the help of England, the Count de Nassau left
Paris with a decisive rejection of the emperor's advances; and in the
beginning of January, De Bryon, the High Admiral of France, was sent to
England, to inform Henry of what had passed, and to propose for Elizabeth
the marriage which Charles had desired for the Princess Mary.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">De Bryon sent to England.</span>
De Bryon's instructions were remarkable. To consolidate the alliance of the
two nations, he was to entreat Henry at length to surrender the claim to
the crown of France, which had been the cause of so many centuries of war.
In return for this concession, Francis would make over to England,
Gravelines, Newport, Dunkirk, a province of Flanders, and "the title of the
Duke of Lorrayne to the town of Antwerp, with sufficient assistance for the
recovery of the same." Henry was not to press Francis to part from the
papacy; and De Bryon seems to have indicated a hope that the English king
might retrace his own steps. The weight of French influence, meanwhile, was
to be pressed, to induce the pope to revoke and denounce, voyd and
frustrate the unjust and slanderous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
sentence<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> given by his
predecessor; and the terms of this new league were to be completed by the
betrothal of the Princess Elizabeth to the Duke of Angoulesme.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>There had been a time when these proposals would have answered all which
Henry desired. In the early days of his reign he had indulged himself in
visions of empire, and of repeating the old glories of the Plantagenet
kings. But in the peace which was concluded after the defeat of Pavia, he
showed that he had resigned himself to a wiser
policy,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and the
surrender of a barren designation would cost him little. In his quarrel
with the pope, also, he had professed an extreme reluctance to impair the
unity of the church; and the sacrifices which he had made, and the years of
persevering struggle which he had endured, had proved that in those
<span class="sidenote">Change in Henry's character.</span>
professions he had not been insincere. But Henry's character was not what
it had been when he won his title of Defender of the Faith. In the
experience of the last few years he had learnt to conceive some broader
sense of the meaning of the Reformation; and he had gathered from Cromwell
and Latimer a more noble conception of the Protestant doctrines. He had
entered upon an active course of legislation for the putting away the
injustices, the falsehoods, the oppressions of a degenerate establishment;
and in the strong sense that he had done right, and nothing else but right,
in these measures, he was not now disposed to submit to a compromise, or to
consent to undo anything which he was satisfied had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> justly done, in
consideration of any supposed benefit which he could receive from the pope.
He was anxious to remain in communion with the see of Rome. He was willing
to acknowledge in some innocuous form the Roman supremacy. But it could be
only on his own terms. The pope must come to him; he could not go to the
pope. And the papal precedency should only again be admitted in England on
conditions which should leave untouched the Act of Appeals, and should
preserve the sovereignty of the crown unimpaired.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Henry's reply to the overtures of the French king.<br /><br />
The pope must make the first move towards a reconciliation.</div>

<p>He replied, therefore, to the overtures of Francis, that he was ready to
enter into negotiations for the resignation or his title to the crown of
France, and for the proposed marriage.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Before any other step was
taken, however, he desired his good brother to insist that "the Bishop of
Rome" should revoke the sentence, and "declare his pretended marriage with
the Lady Catherine naught;" "which to do," Henry wrote (and this portion of
his reply is written by his own hand), "we think it very facile for our
good brother; since we do perceive by letters [from Rome] both the opinions
of the learned men there to be of that opinion that we be of; and also a
somewhat disposition to that purpose in the Bishop of Rome's self,
according to equity, reason, and the laws both positive and divine." If
there was to be a reconciliation with the Holy See, the first advance must
be made on the Bishop of Rome's side; and Cromwell, in a simultaneous

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Henry, however, felt no confidence either in the sincerity of the pope, or
in the sincerity of the French king, as he haughtily showed. He did not
even trust De Bryon's account of the rejection of the overtures of the
emperor. "If it happeneth," he wrote, "that the said Bishop will
obstinately follow the steps of his predecessor, and be more inclined to
the maintenance of the actions and sentences of his see than to equity and
justice, then we trust that our good brother&mdash;perceiving the right to stand
on our side, and that not only the universities of his whole realm and
dominions hath so defined, but also the most part of the rest of
Christendom, and also the best learned men of the Bishop of Rome's own
council, now being called for that purpose&mdash;will fully and wholly, both he
and his whole realm, adhere and cleave to us and our doings in this behalf;
and we herein desire shortly to have answer, which we would be right loth
should be such as whereupon we might take any occasion of suspicion;
trusting, further, that our said good brother will both promise unto us
upon his word, and indeed perform, that in the meantime, before the meeting
of our deputies,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> he nor directly nor indirectly shall practise or set
forth any mean or intelligence of marriage, or of other practices with the
emperour."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The pope makes indirect advances, which are received also with
coldness.</div>

<p>So cold an answer could have arisen only from deep distrust; it is
difficult to say whether the distrust was wholly deserved. Analogous
advances, made indirectly from the pope were met with the same reserve. Sir
Gregory Cassalis wrote to Cromwell, that Farnese, or Paul III., as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> he was
now called, had expressed the greatest desire to please the king. He had
sent for lawyers out of Tuscany, on whose judgment he had great reliance,
and these lawyers had given an opinion that the pope might <i>ex officio</i>
annul the first marriage as Henry desired, and pronounce the second
valid.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
<span class="sidenote">January.</span>
This was well, but it did not go beyond words; and of these
there had been too many. The English government had fed upon "the
cameleon's dish," "eating the air promise crammed," till they were weary of
so weak a diet, and they desired something more substantial. If the pope,
replied Cromwell, be really well disposed, let him show his disposition in
some public manner, "of his own accord, with a desire only for the truth,
and without waiting till the King's Majesty entreat him."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> It would
have been more courteous, and perhaps it would have been more just, if the
French overtures had been met in a warmer spirit; for the policy of Francis
required for the time a cordial understanding with England; and his conduct
seems to prove that he was sincerely anxious to win the pope to
complacency.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> But Henry's experience guided him wisely with the Roman
Bishop; and if he had been entangled into confidence in Farnese, he would
have been entangled to his ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The language of the papacy had been inconsistent, but its
conduct had been uniform.</div>

<p>The spring of 1535 was consumed in promises, negotiations, and a repetition
of the profitless story of the preceding years. Suddenly, in the midst of
the unreality, it became clear that one man at least was serious. Henry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
with an insurgent Ireland and a mutinous England upon his hands, had no
leisure for diplomatic finesse; he had learnt his lesson with Clement, and
was not to be again deceived. The language of the Roman see had been
inconsistent, but the actions of it had been always uniform. From the first
beginning of the dispute to the final break and excommunication, in the
teeth of his promises, his flatteries, his acknowledgments, Clement had
been the partisan of Catherine. When the English agents were collecting the
opinions of the Italian universities, they were thwarted by his emissaries.
He had intrigued against Henry in Scotland; he had tampered with Henry's
English and Irish subjects; he had maintained a secret correspondence with
Catherine herself. And so well had his true feelings and the true position
of the question been understood by the papal party in England, that at the
very time when at Marseilles and elsewhere the pope himself was admitting
the justice of the king's demand, the religious orders who were most
unwavering in their allegiance to the papacy, were pressing their
opposition to the divorce into rebellion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Until the pope, therefore, shows some change in action, the
penal laws may not be arrested.</div>

<p>When, therefore, the chair of St. Peter was filled by a new occupant, and
language of the same smooth kind began again to issue from it, the English
government could not for so light a cause consent to arrest their measures,
or suspend the action of laws which had been passed from a conviction of
their necessity. Whatever might become of French marriages, or of the
cession of a corner of the Netherlands and a few towns upon the coast in
exchange for a gaudy title, the English Reformation must continue its way;
the nation must be steered clear among the reefs and shoals of treason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
The late statutes had not been passed without a cause; and when occasion
came to enforce them, were not to pass off, like the thunders of the
Vatican, in impotent noise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The martyrdoms of Catholics and Protestants analogous to deaths
in battle.</div>

<p>Here, therefore, we are to enter upon one of the grand scenes of history; a
solemn battle fought out to the death, yet fought without ferocity, by the
champions of rival principles. Heroic men had fallen, and were still fast
falling, for what was called heresy; and now those who had inflicted death
on others were called upon to bear the same witness to their own sincerity.
England became the theatre of a war between two armies of martyrs, to be
waged, not upon the open field, in open action, but on the stake and on the
scaffold, with the nobler weapons of passive endurance. Each party were
ready to give their blood; each party were ready to shed the blood of their
antagonists; and the sword was to single out its victims in the rival
ranks, not as in peace among those whose crimes made them dangerous to
society, but, as on the field of battle, where the most conspicuous courage
most challenges the aim of the enemy. It was war, though under the form of
peace; and if we would understand the true spirit of the time, we must
regard Catholics and Protestants as gallant soldiers, whose deaths, when
they fall, are not painful, but glorious; and whose devotion we are equally
able to admire, even where we cannot equally approve their cause. Courage
and self-sacrifice are beautiful alike in an enemy and in a friend. And
while we exult in that chivalry with which the Smithfield martyrs bought
England's freedom with their blood, so we will not refuse our admiration to
those other gallant men whose high forms, in the sunset of the old faith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
stand transfigured on the horizon, tinged with the light of its dying
glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />The monks of the London Charterhouse.</div>

<p>Secretary Bedyll, as we saw above, complained to Cromwell of the obstinacy
of certain friars and monks, who, he thought, would confer a service on the
country by dying quietly, lest honest men should incur unmerited obloquy in
putting them to death. Among these, the brethren of the London Charterhouse
were specially mentioned as recalcitrant, and they were said at the same
time to bear a high reputation for holiness. In a narrative written by a
member of this body, we are brought face to face, at their time of trial,
with one of the few religious establishments in England which continued to
deserve the name; and we may see, in the scenes which are there described,
the highest representation of struggles which graduated variously according
to character and temper, and, without the tragical result, may have been
witnessed in very many of the monastic houses. The writer was a certain
Maurice Channey, probably an Irishman. He went through the same sufferings
with the rest of the brethren, and was one of the small fraction who
finally gave way under the trial. He was set at liberty, and escaped
abroad; and in penance for his weakness, he left on record the touching
story of his fall, and of the triumph of his bolder companions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of Maurice Channey.</div>

<p>He commences with his own confession. He had fallen when others stood. He
was, as he says, an unworthy brother, a Saul among the prophets, a Judas
among the apostles, a child of Ephraim turning himself back in the day of
battle&mdash;for which his cowardice, while his brother monks were saints in
heaven, he was doing penance in sorrow, tossing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
on the waves of the wide
world. The early chapters contain a loving lingering picture of his
cloister life&mdash;to him the perfection of earthly happiness. It is placed
before us, in all its superstition, its devotion, and its simplicity, the
counterpart, even in minute details, of the stories of the Saxon recluses
when monasticism was in the young vigour of its life. St. Bede or St.
Cuthbert might have found himself in the house of the London Carthusians,
and he would have had few questions to ask, and no duties to learn or to
unlearn. The form of the buildings would have seemed more elaborate; the
notes of the organ would have added richer solemnity to the services; but
<span class="sidenote">Unity of the monastic life.</span>
the salient features of the scene would have been all familiar. He would
have lived in a cell of the same shape, he would have thought the same
thoughts, spoken the same words in the same language. The prayers, the
daily life, almost the very faces with which he was surrounded, would have
seemed all unaltered. A thousand years of the world's history had rolled
by, and these lonely islands of prayer had remained still anchored in the
stream; the strands of the ropes which held them, wearing now to a thread,
and very near their last parting, but still unbroken. What they had been
they were; and, if Maurice Channey's description had come down to us as the
account of the monastery in which Offa of Mercia did penance for his
crimes, we could have detected no internal symptoms of a later age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Channey's description of it.</div>

<p>His pages are filled with the old familiar stories of visions and miracles;
of strange adventures befalling the chalices and holy wafers;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> of
angels with wax candles; innocent phantoms which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> flitted round brains and
minds fevered by asceticism. There are accounts of certain <i>fratres reprobi
et eorum terribilis punitio</i>&mdash;frail brethren and the frightful catastrophes
which ensued to them.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Brother Thomas, who told stories out of doors,
<i>apud s&aelig;culares</i>, was attacked one night by the devil; and the fiend would
have strangled him but for the prayers of a companion. Brother George, who
craved after the fleshpots of Egypt, was walking one day about the cloister
when he ought to have been at chapel, and the great figure upon the cross
at the end of the gallery turned its back upon him as it hung, and drove
him all but mad. Brother John Daly found fault with his dinner, and said
that he would as soon eat toads&mdash;<i>Mira res! Justus Deus non fraudavit eum
desiderio suo</i>&mdash;his cell was for three months filled with toads. If he
threw them into the fire, they hopped back to him unscorched; if he killed
them, others came to take their place.</p>

<p>But these bad brothers were rare exceptions. In general the house was
perhaps the best ordered in England. The hospitality was well sustained,
the charities were profuse, and whatever we may think of the intellect
which could busy itself with fancies seemingly so childish, the monks were
<span class="sidenote">Character of Haughton, the prior.</span>
true to their vows, and true to their duty as far as they comprehended what
duty meant. Among many good, the prior John Haughton was the best. He was
of an old English family, and had been educated at Cambridge, where he must
have been the contemporary of Latimer. At the age of twenty-eight he took
the vows as a monk, and had been twenty years a Carthusian at the opening
of the troubles of the Reformation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> He is described as "small in stature,
in figure graceful, in countenance dignified." "In manner he was most
modest; in eloquence most sweet; in chastity without stain." We may readily
imagine his appearance; with that feminine austerity of expression which,
as has been well said, belongs so peculiarly to the features of the
medi&aelig;val ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>Such was the society of the monks of the Charterhouse, who, in an era too
late for their continuance, and guilty of being unable to read the signs of
<span class="sidenote">The monks espouse the side of Queen Catherine.</span>
the times, were summoned to wage unequal battle with the world. From the
commencement of the divorce cause they had espoused instinctively the
queen's side; they had probably, in common with their affiliated house at
Sion, believed unwisely in the Nun of Kent; and, as pious Catholics, they
regarded the reforming measures of the parliament with dismay and
consternation. The year 1533, says Maurice,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> was ushered in with signs
in heaven and prodigies upon earth, as if the end of the world was at hand;
as indeed of the monks and the monks' world the end was truly at hand. And
then came the spring of 1534, when the act was passed cutting off the
Princess Mary from the succession, and requiring of all subjects of the
realm an oath of allegiance to Elizabeth, and a recognition of the king's
marriage with Queen Anne. Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher went to the
Tower, as we saw, rather than swear; and about the same time the royal
commissioners appeared at the Charterhouse to require the submission of the
brethren. The regular clergy through the kingdom had bent to the storm. The
conscience of the London Carthusians was less elastic; they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">They are required to take the oath of allegiance, and refuse.</span>
the first and, with the exception of More and Fisher, the only recusants. "The prior
did answer to the commissioners," Maurice tells us, "that he knew nothing
of such matters, and could not meddle with them; and they continuing to
insist, and the prior being still unable to give other answer, he was sent
with Father Humphrey, our proctor, to the Tower." There he remained for a
month; and at the end of it he was persuaded by "certain good and learned
men"<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
<span class="sidenote">The prior is persuaded to submit, <i>sub conditione</i>.</span>
that the cause was not one for which it was lawful to suffer. He
undertook to comply, <i>sub conditione</i>, with some necessary reservations,
and was sent home to the cloister. As soon as he returned, the brethren
assembled in their chapter-house "in confusion and great perplexity," and
Haughton told them what he had promised. He would submit, he said, and yet
his misgivings foretold to him that a submission so made could not long
avail. "Our hour, dear brethren," he continued, "is not yet come. In the
<span class="sidenote">The prior's dream.<br /><br />
The monks hesitate,<br /><br /><br />
But at last yield.</span>
same night in which we were set free I had a dream that I should not escape
thus. Within a year I shall be brought again to that place, and then I
shall finish my course." If martyrdom was so near and so inevitable, the
remainder of the monks were at first reluctant to purchase a useless delay
at the price of their convictions. The commissioners came with the lord
mayor for the oath, and it was refused. They came again, with the threat of
instant imprisonment for the whole fraternity; "and then," says Maurice,
"they prevailed with us. We all swore as we were required, making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> one
condition, that we submitted only so far as it was lawful for us so to do.
Thus, like Jonah, we were delivered from the belly of this monster, this
immanis ceta, and began again to rejoice like him, under the shadow of the
gourd of our home. But it is better to trust in the Lord than in princes,
in whom is no salvation; God had prepared a worm that smote our gourd and
made it to perish."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>This worm, as may be supposed, was the act of supremacy, with the statute
of treasons which was attached to it. It was ruled, as I have said, that
inadequate answers to official inquiry formed sufficient ground for
prosecution under these acts. But this interpretation was not generally
known; nor among those who knew it was it certain whether the crown would
avail itself of the powers which it thus possessed, or whether it would
proceed only against such offenders as had voluntarily committed themselves
<span class="sidenote">The convent hears of the Treason Act.</span>
to opposition. In the opening of the following year [1535] the first
uncertainty was at an end; it was publicly understood that persons who had
previously given cause for suspicion might be submitted to question. When
this bitter news was no longer doubtful, the prior called the convent
together, and gave them notice to prepare for what was coming. They lay
already under the shadow of treason; and he anticipated, among other evil
consequences of disobedience, the immediate dissolution of the house. Even
he, with all his forebodings, was unprepared for the course which would
really be taken with them. "When we were all in great consternation,"
writes our author, "he said to us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prior's address.</div>

<p>"'Very sorry am I, and my heart is heavy, espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>cially for you, my younger
friends, of whom I see so many round me. Here you are living in your
innocence. The yoke will not be laid on your necks, nor the rod of
persecution. But if you are taken hence, and mingle among the Gentiles, you
may learn the works of them, and having begun in the spirit you may be
consumed in the flesh. And there may be others among us whose hearts are
still infirm. If these mix again with the world, I fear how it may be with
them; and what shall I say, and what shall I do, if I cannot save those
whom God has trusted to my charge?'</p>

<p>"Then all who were present," says Channey, "burst into tears, and cried
with one voice, 'Let us die together in our integrity, and heaven and earth
shall witness for us how unjustly we are cut off.'</p>

<p>"The prior answered, sadly,&mdash;'Would, indeed, that it might be so; that so
dying we might live, as living we die&mdash;but they will not do to us so great
a kindness, nor to themselves so great an injury. Many of you are of noble
blood; and what I think they will do is this: Me and the elder brethren
they will kill; and they will dismiss you that are young into a world which
is not for you.<span class="sidenote">If it may be so, the prior will make himself anathema for his
brethren.</span>
<i>If, therefore, it depend on me alone&mdash;if my oath will
suffice for the house&mdash;I will throw myself for your sakes on the mercy of
God. I will make myself anathema; and to preserve you from these dangers, I
will consent to the king's will.</i> If, however, they have determined
otherwise&mdash;if they choose to have the consent of us all&mdash;the will of God be
done. If one death will not avail, we will die all.'</p>

<p>"So then, bidding us prepare for the worst, that the Lord when he knocked
might find us ready, he desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> us to choose each our confessor, and to
confess our sins one to another, giving us power to grant each other
absolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />The brethren make their preparations.</div>

<p>"The day after he preached a sermon in the chapel on the 59th Psalm,&mdash;'O
God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast destroyed us;'<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> concluding with
the words, 'It is better that we should suffer here a short penance for our
faults, than be reserved for the eternal pains of hell hereafter;'&mdash;and so
ending, he turned to us and bade us all do as we saw him do. Then rising
from his place he went direct to the eldest of the brethren, who was
sitting nearest to himself, and kneeling before him, begged his forgiveness
for any offence which in heart, word, or deed, he might have committed
against him. Thence he proceeded to the next, and said the same; and so to
the next, through us all, we following him and saying as he did, each from
each imploring pardon."</p>

<p>Thus, with unobtrusive nobleness, did these poor men prepare themselves for
their end; not less beautiful in their resolution, not less deserving the
everlasting remembrance of mankind, than those three hundred who in the
summer morning sate combing their golden hair in the passes of Thermopyl&aelig;.
We will not regret their cause; there is no cause for which any man can
more nobly suffer than to witness that it is better for him to die than to
speak words which he does not mean. Nor, in this their hour of trial, were
they left without higher comfort.</p>

<p>"The third day after," the story goes on, "was the mass of the Holy Ghost,
and God made known his presence among us. For when the host was lifted up,
there came as it were a whisper of air, which breathed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> upon our faces as
we knelt. Some perceived it with the bodily senses; all felt it as it
thrilled into their hearts. And then followed a sweet, soft sound of music,
at which our venerable father was so moved, God being thus abundantly
manifest among us, that he sank down in tears, and for a long time could
not continue the service&mdash;we all remaining stupified, hearing the melody,
and feeling the marvellous effects of it upon our spirits, but knowing
neither whence it came nor whither it went. Only our hearts rejoiced as we
perceived that God was with us indeed."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The government are in no haste to enforce the statutes.</div>

<p>Comforted and resolute, the brotherhood awaited patiently the approach of
the commissioners; and they waited long, for the crown was in no haste to
be severe. The statutes had been passed in no spirit of cruelty; they were
weapons to be used in case of extremity; and there was no attempt to
enforce them until forbearance was misconstrued into fear. Sir Thomas More
and the Bishop of Rochester remained unquestioned in the Tower, and were
allowed free intercourse with their friends. The Carthusian monks were left
undisturbed, although the attitude which they had assumed was notorious,
and although the prior was known to forbid his penitents in confession to
acknowledge the king's supremacy. If the government was at length driven to
severity, it was because the clergy forced them to it in spite of
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of the clergy.</div>

<p>The clergy had taken the oath, but they held themselves under no obligation
to observe it; or if they observed the orders of the crown in the letter,
they thwarted those orders in the spirit. The Treason Act had for awhile
overawed them; but finding that its threats were confined to language, that
months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> passed away, and that no person had as yet been prosecuted, they
fell back into open opposition, either careless of the consequences, or
believing that the government did not dare to exert its powers. The details
of their conduct during the spring months of this year I am unable to
discover; but it was such as at length, on the 17th of April, provoked the
following circular to the lords-lieutenant of the various counties:<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>In obvious connexion with the issue of this publication, the monks of the
Charterhouse were at length informed that they would be questioned on the
supremacy. The great body of the religious houses had volunteered an
outward submission. The London Carthusians, with other affiliated
establishments, had remained passive, and had thus furnished an open
encouragement to disobedience. We are instinctively inclined to censure an
interference with persons who at worst were but dreamers of the cloister;

the Bible. It was the habit of the time, as it is the habit of all times of
real danger, to spare the multitude but to strike the leaders, to make
responsibility the shadow of power, to choose for punishment the most
efficacious representatives of the spirit which it was necessary to subdue.</p>

<p>The influence of the Carthusians, with that of the two great men who were
following the same road to the same goal, determined multitudes in the
attitude which they would assume, and in the duty which they would choose.
The Carthusians, therefore, were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> be made to bend; or if they could not
be bent, to be made examples in their punishment, as they had made
themselves examples in their resistance. They were noble and good; but
there were others in England good and noble as they, who were not of their
fold; and whose virtues, thenceforward more required by England than
cloistered asceticisms, had been blighted under the shadow of the papacy.
The Catholics had chosen the alternative, either to crush the free thought
which was bursting from the soil, or else to be crushed by it; and the
future of the world could not be sacrificed to preserve the exotic graces
of medi&aelig;val saints. They fell, gloriously and not unprofitably. They were
not allowed to stay the course of the Reformation; but their sufferings,
nobly borne, sufficed to recover the sympathy of after-ages for the faith
which they professed. Ten righteous men were found in the midst of the
corruption to purchase for Romanism a few more centuries of tolerated
endurance.</p>

<p>To return to the narrative of Maurice Channey. Notice of the intention of
the government having been signified to the order, Father Webster and
Father Lawrence, the priors of the two daughter houses of Axholm and
Belville, came up to London three weeks after Easter, and, with Haughton,
presented themselves before Cromwell with an entreaty to be excused the
<span class="sidenote">The prior with three others are sent to the Tower,</span>

submission. For answer to their petition they were sent to the Tower, where
they were soon after joined by Father Reynolds, one of the recalcitrant
monks of Sion. These four were brought on the 26th of April before a
committee of the privy council, of which Cromwell was one. The act of
supremacy was laid before them, and they were required to signify their
acceptance of it. They refused,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and two days after they were brought to
<span class="sidenote">And brought to trial, April 28.</span>
trial before a special commission. They pleaded all "not guilty." They had
of course broken the act; but they would not acknowledge that guilt could
be involved in disobedience to a law which was itself unlawful. Their words
in the Tower to the privy council formed the matter of the charge against
them. It appears from the record that on their examination, "they,
treacherously machinating and desiring to deprive the king our sovereign
lord of his title of supreme Head of the Church of England, did openly
declare and say, the king our sovereign lord is not supreme Head on earth
of the Church of England."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />Haughton's language at the bar.</div>

<p>But their conduct on the trial, or at least the conduct of Haughton, spared
all difficulty in securing a conviction. The judges pressed the prior "not
to shew so little wisdom as to maintain his own opinion against the consent
of the realm." He replied, that he had resolved originally to imitate the
example of his Master before Herod, and say nothing. "But since you urge
me," he continued, "that I may satisfy my own conscience and the
consciences of these who are present, I will say that our opinion, if it
might go by the suffrages of men, would have more witnesses than yours. You
can produce on your side but the parliament of a single kingdom; I, on
mine, have the whole Christian world except that kingdom. Nor have you all
even of your own people. The lesser part is with you. The majority, who
seem to be with you, do but dissemble, to gain favour with the king, or for
fear they should lose their honours and their dignities."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Cromwell asked him of whom he was speaking. "Of all the good men in the
realm," he replied; "and when his Majesty knows the truth, I know well he
will be beyond measure offended with those of his bishops who have given
him the counsel which he now follows."</p>

<p>"Why," said another of the judges, "have you, contrary to the king's
authority within the realm, persuaded so many persons as you have done to
disobey the king and parliament?"</p>

<p>"I have declared my opinion," he answered, "to no man living but to those
who came to me in confession, which in discharge of my conscience I could
not refuse. But if I did not declare it then, I will declare it now,
because I am thereto obliged to God."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
He neither looked for mercy nor
<span class="sidenote">Thursday, April 29.</span>
desired it. A writ was issued for the return of a petty jury the following
day. The prisoners were taken back to the Tower, and the next morning were
brought again to the bar. Feron and Hale, the two priests whose
conversation had been overheard at Sion, were placed on their trial at the
<span class="sidenote">The prisoners are condemned.</span>
same time. The two latter threw themselves on the mercy of the court. A
verdict of guilty was returned against the other four. The sentence was for
the usual punishment of high treason. Feron was pardoned; I do not find on
what account. Hale and the Carthusians were to suffer together. When
Haughton heard the sentence, he merely said, "This is the judgment of the
world."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">May 4. The execution.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
An interval of five days was allowed after the trial. On the 4th of May,
the execution took place at Tyburn, under circumstances which marked the
occasion with peculiar meaning. The punishment in cases of high treason was
very terrible. I need not dwell upon the form of it. The English were a
hard, fierce people; and with these poor sufferers the law of the land took
its course without alleviation or interference. But another feature
<span class="sidenote">They are brought to the scaffold in their habits.</span>
distinguished the present execution. For the first time in English history,
ecclesiastics were brought out to suffer in their habits, without
undergoing the previous ceremony of degradation. Thenceforward the world
were to know, that as no sanctuary any more should protect traitors, so the
sacred office should avail as little; and the hardest blow which it had yet
received was thus dealt to superstition, shaking from its place in the
minds of all men the key-stone of the whole system.</p>

<p>To the last moment escape was left open, if the prisoners would submit.
Several members of the council attended them to the closing scene, for a
last effort of kindness; but they had chosen their course, and were not to
<span class="sidenote">Haughton dies first.</span>
be moved from it. Haughton, as first in rank, had the privilege of first
dying. When on the scaffold, in compliance with the usual custom, he spoke
a few touching and simple words to the people. "I call to witness Almighty
God," he said, "and all good people, and I beseech
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> you all here present to
bear witness for me in the day of judgment, that being here to die, I
declare that it is from no obstinate rebellious spirit that I do not obey
the king, but because I fear to offend the Majesty of God. Our holy mother
the church has decreed otherwise than the king and the parliament have
decreed, and therefore, rather than disobey the church, I am ready to
suffer. Pray for me, and have mercy on my brethren, of whom I have been the
unworthy prior." He then knelt down, repeating the first few verses of the
31st Psalm,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
and after a few moments delivered himself to the
<span class="sidenote">The council urges the rest to submit, but in vain.</span>
executioner. The others followed, undaunted. As one by one they went to
their death, the council, at each fresh horrible spectacle, urged the
survivors to have pity on themselves; but they urged them in vain. The
faces of these men did not grow pale; their voices did not shake; they
declared themselves liege subjects of the king, and obedient children of
holy church; "giving God thanks that they were held worthy to suffer for
the truth."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> All died without a murmur. The stern work was ended with
quartering the bodies; and the arm of Haughton was hung up as a bloody sign
over the archway of the Charterhouse, to awe the remaining brothers into
submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 10. Three more Carthusians tried and executed.</div>

<p>But the spirit of the old martyrs was in these friars. One of them, like
the Theban sister, bore away the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> honoured relic and buried it; and all
resolved to persist in their resigned opposition. Six weeks were allowed
them to consider. At the end of that time three more were taken, tried, and
hanged;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and this still proving ineffectual, Cromwell hesitated to
proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cromwell hesitates.<br /><br />
Close of the story of the Carthusians.</div>

<p>The end of the story is very touching and may be told briefly, that I may
not have occasion to return to it. Maurice's account is probably
exaggerated, and is written in a tone of strong emotion; but it has all the
substantial features of truth. The remaining monks were left in the house;
and two secular priests were sent to take charge of the establishment, who
starved and ill-used them; and were themselves, according to Maurice,
sensual and profligate. From time to time they were called before the privy
council. Their friends and relatives were ordered to work upon them. No
effort either of severity or kindness was spared to induce them to submit;
as if their attitude, so long as it was maintained, was felt as a reproach
by the government. At last, four were carried down to Westminster Abbey, to
hear the Bishop of Durham deliver his famous sermon against the pope; and
when this rhetorical inanity had also failed, and as they were thought to
confirm one another in their obstinacy, they were dispersed among other
houses the temper of which could be depended upon. Some were sent to the
north; others to Sion, where a new prior had been appointed, of zealous
loyalty; others were left at home to be disciplined by the questionable
seculars. But nothing answered. Two found their way into active rebellion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
and being concerned in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were hung in chains at
<span class="sidenote">They will not yield, and are crushed.</span>
York. Ten were sent to Newgate, where nine died miserably of prison fever
and filth;<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> the tenth survivor was executed. The remainder, of whom
Maurice was one, went through a form of submission, with a mental
reservation, and escaped abroad.</p>

<p>So fell the monks of the London Charterhouse, splintered to pieces&mdash;for so
only could their resistance be overcome&mdash;by the iron sceptre and the iron
hand which held it. They were, however, alone of their kind. There were
many perhaps who wished to resemble them, who would have imitated their
<span class="sidenote">The necessity was a cruel one, but the government are not to be
blamed.</span>
example had they dared. But all bent except these. If it had been
otherwise, the Reformation would have been impossible, and perhaps it would
not have been needed. Their story claims from us that sympathy which is the
due of their exalted courage. But we cannot blame the government. Those who
know what the condition of the country really was, must feel their
inability to suggest, with any tolerable reasonableness, what else could
have been done. They may regret so hard a necessity, but they will regret
in silence. The king, too, was not without feeling. It was no matter of
indifference to him that he found himself driven to such stern courses with
his subjects; and as the golden splendour of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
manhood was thus sullenly
<span class="sidenote">The king orders the court into mourning.</span>
clouding, "he commanded all about his court to poll their heads," in public
token of mourning; "and to give them example, he caused his own head to be
polled; and from thenceforth his beard to be knotted, and to be no more
shaven."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">May 8. Other martyrs who were not Catholics.</div>

<p>The friars of Charterhouse suffered for the Catholic faith, as Protestants
had suffered, and were still to suffer, for a faith fairer than theirs. In
this same month of May, in the same year, the English annals contain
another entry of no less sad significance. The bishops, as each day they
parted further from their old allegiance, and were called in consequence by
the hateful name of heretics, were increasingly anxious to prove by evident
tokens their zeal for the true faith; and although the late act of heresy
had moderated their powers, yet power enough remained to enable them to
work their will upon all extreme offenders. Henry, also, it is likely, was
not sorry of an opportunity of showing that his justice was even-handed,
and that a schism from the papacy was not a lapse into heterodoxy. His mind
was moving. Latimer and Shaxton, who three years before had been on trial
for their lives, were soon to be upon the bench; and in the late
injunctions, the Bible, and not the decrees of the church, had been held up
as the canon of truth. But heresy, though the definition of it was
changing, remained a crime; and although the limits of permitted belief
were imperceptibly enlarging, to transgress the recognised boundaries was
an offence enormous as ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popular estimate of the Anabaptists.</div>

<p>If we can conceive the temper with which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> reasonable and practical
English at present regard the Socialists of the continent, deepened by an
intensity of conviction of which these later ages have had but little
experience, we can then imagine the light in which the Anabaptists of the
Netherlands appeared in the eyes or orthodox Europe. If some opinions, once
thought heretical, were regarded with less agitated repugnance, the heresy
of these enemies of mankind was patent to the world. On them the laws of
the country might take their natural course, and no voice was raised to
speak for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 25.</div>

<p>We find, therefore, in Stow's <i>Chronicle</i>, the following: brief entry: "The
five and twentieth day of May were, in St. Paul's church, London, examined
nineteen men and six women, born in Holland, whose opinions were&mdash;first,
that in Christ is not two natures, God and man; secondly, that Christ took
neither flesh nor blood of the Virgin Mary; thirdly, that children born of
infidels may be saved; fourthly, that baptism of children is of none
effect; fifthly, that the sacrament of Christ's body is but bread only;
sixthly, that he who after baptism sinneth wittingly, sinneth deadly, and
<span class="sidenote">Fourteen of them are executed.</span>
cannot be saved. Fourteen of them were condemned: a man and a woman were
burnt at Smithfield. The remaining twelve were scattered among other towns,
there to be burnt."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
The details are gone,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> names are gone.
Poor Hollanders they were, and that is all. Scarcely the fact seemed worth
the mention, so shortly it is told in a passing paragraph. For them no
Europe was agitated, no courts were ordered into mourning, no papal hearts
trembled with indignation. At their deaths the world looked on complacent,
indifferent, or exulting. Yet here, too, out of twenty-five common men and
women were found fourteen who, by no terror of stake or torture, could be
<span class="sidenote">They too did not die in vain.</span>
tempted to say that they believed what they did not believe. History for
them has no word of praise; yet they, too, were not giving their blood in
vain. Their lives might have been as useless as the lives of most of us. In
their deaths they assisted to pay the purchase-money for England's freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fisher and More.<br /><br /><br />
Fisher's dangerous imprudence.</div>

<p>After the execution of the Carthusians, it became a question what should be
done with the Bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More. They had remained
for a year in the Tower, undisturbed; and there is no reason to think that
they would have been further troubled, except for the fault of one, if not
of both. It appeared, however, on the trial of Father Reynolds, that
Fisher's imprudence or zeal had tempted him again to meddle with dangerous
matters. A correspondence had passed between the bishop and the
king,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
on the Act of Supremacy, or on some subject connected with it. The king had
taken no public notice of Fisher's words, but he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
had required a promise
that the letter should not be shown to any other person. The unwise old man
gave his word, but he did not observe it; he sent copies both of what he
had himself written and of the king's answer to the Sion
monks,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
furnishing them at the same time with a copy of the book which he had
written against the divorce, and two other books, written by Abel, the
queen's confessor, and the Spanish ambassador. Whether he was discovered to
have held any other correspondence, or whether anything of an analogous
<span class="sidenote">Treatment and conduct of Fisher and of More in the Tower.</span>
kind was proved against More, I am unable to discover. Both he and Fisher
had been treated with greater indulgence than was usual with
prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
Their own attendants had waited on them; they were allowed
to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
visits from their relatives within the Tower walls, and to
correspond with their families and
friends.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
As a matter of course,
under such circumstances, they must have expressed their opinions on the
great subject of the day; and those opinions were made known throughout
England, and, indeed, throughout Europe. Whether they did more than this,
or whether they had only indirectly allowed their influence to be used
against the government, must be left to conjecture. But the language of a
document under the king's hand speaks of their having given some cause of
<span class="sidenote">Cromwell's charges against them.</span>
provocation, of no common kind; and this is confirmed by Cromwell, who was
once deeply attached to More. "When they were in strait keeping," say the
instructions to the Bishop of Hereford, "having nevertheless the prison at
their liberties, they ceased not both to practise an insurrection within
the realm, and also to use all the devices to them possible in outward
parts, as well to defame and slander his Majesty, and his most virtuous
doings and proceedings, as also to procure the impeachment and other
destruction of his most royal person."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Cromwell speaks also of their
having been engaged in definite schemes, the object of which was
rebellion;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and although we have here the <i>ex parte</i> statement of the
government, and although such a charge would have been held to be justified
by a proof that they had spoken generally against the Act of Supremacy, it
may be allowed to prove that so far they were really guilty; and it is
equally cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>tain that for these two men to have spoken against the act was
to have lent encouragement to the party of insurrection, the most powerful
which that party could have received.</p>

<p>Thus, by another necessity, Fisher and More, at the beginning of May, were
called upon for their submission. It was a hard case, for the bishop was
sinking into the grave with age and sickness, and More had the highest
reputation of any living man. But they had chosen to make themselves
conspicuous as confessors for Catholic truth; though prisoners in the
Tower, they were in fact the most effectual champions of the papal claims;
and if their disobedience had been passed over, the statute could have been
enforced against no one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 7. A deputation of the council waits upon them in the Tower.
They refuse to admit the supremacy.</div>

<p>The same course was followed as with the Carthusian monks. On the 7th of
May a deputation of the council waited on the prisoners in the Tower, for
an acknowledgment of the supremacy. They refused: Fisher, after a brief
hesitation, peremptorily; More declining to answer, but also giving an
indirect denial. After repeated efforts had been made to move them, and
made in vain, their own language, as in the preceding trials, furnished
material for their indictment; and the law officers of the crown who were
to conduct the prosecution were the witnesses under whose evidence they
were to be tried. It was a strange proceeding, to be excused only, if
excused at all, by the pressure of the
times.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Either the king or his ministers, however, were slow in making up their
minds. With the Carthusians, nine days only were allowed to elapse between
the first examination and the final close at Tyburn. The case against More
<span class="sidenote">The government delay their trial.</span>
and Fisher was no less clear than against the monks; yet five weeks elapsed
and the government still hesitated. Perhaps they were influenced by the
high position of the greater offenders,&mdash;perhaps there was some fear of the
world's opinion, which, though it might be indifferent to the sacrifice of
a few obscure ecclesiastics, yet would surely not pass over lightly the
execution of men who stood out with so marked pre&euml;minence. The council
board was unevenly composed. Cromwell, who divides with the king the
responsibility of these prosecutions, had succeeded, not to the authority
only of Wolsey, but to the hatred with which the ignoble plebeian was
regarded by the patricians who were compelled to stoop before him. Lord
Exeter was already looking with a cold eye on the revolution; and Norfolk
and Suffolk, though zealous as the king himself for the independence of
England, yet had all the instincts of aristocratic conservatism. Even
Cromwell may have desired the triumph of winning over converts so
distinguished, or may have shrunk from the odium which their deaths would
bring upon him. Whatever was the cause of the delay, the privy council, who
had been contented with a single examination of Haughton and his
companions, struggled with their present difficulty week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> after week; and
it is possible that, except from an extraneous impulse, some mode of escape
might have been discovered. But as the sentence of Clement sealed the fate
of the Nun of Kent, so the unwisdom of his successor bore similarly fatal
fruits.</p>

<p>Paul III. had throughout the spring flattered Henry with expressions of
sympathy, and had held out hopes of an approaching change of policy. He
chose the present unfortunate juncture to expose the vanity of these
professions; and as an intimation of the course which he intended to
follow, he named the Bishop of Rochester, the one bishop who remained
attached to Catherine's cause, a cardinal. Henry had appealed to a council,
<span class="sidenote">The pope names Fisher a cardinal.</span>
which the pope had promised to call; and Fisher, of all Englishmen, was
chosen as the person whom the pope desired to represent the nation on its
assembly. Even the very conclave at Rome were taken by surprise, and
expressed themselves in no measured terms at the impolicy of this most
foolish action. Cassalis, aware of the effect which the news would produce
in England, hurried to such friends as he possessed in the conclave to
protest against the appointment. The king, he said, would inevitably regard
it as injurious to the realm and insulting to himself;<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and it was
madness at such a moment to trifle with Henry's displeasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassalis protests, and the pope condescends to falsehood.</div>

<p>The Pope, alarmed at the expressions which he was told that Cassalis had
used, sent in haste to urge him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> if possible, to allay the storm. He was
not ashamed to stoop to falsehood&mdash;but falsehood too awkward to deceive
even the most willing credulity. He had thought, he said, of nothing but to
please Henry. He had been urged by the King of France to seek a
reconciliation with England, and in sending a hat to an English bishop he
had meant nothing but a compliment. The general council would be held
immediately; and it was desirable, according to the constitution of the
church, that a cardinal of every nation should be present. He had no
especial reason for choosing the Bishop of Rochester, except that he had a
high reputation for learning, and he imagined, therefore, that the king
would be gratified.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> "He implored me," Cassalis wrote, "to make his
excuses to his Majesty, and to assure him how deeply he regretted his
mistake, especially when I assured him that the step was of a kind which
admitted of no excuse."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Cassalis himself was afterwards disposed to believe that the appointment
was made in thoughtlessness, and that the pope at the moment had really
forgotten Fisher's
position.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
But this could gain no credit in England.
The news reached the government in the middle of June, and determined the
fate of the unfortunate bishop; and with it the fate, also, of his nobler
<span class="sidenote">The appointment seals Fisher's fate.</span>
companion. To the king, the pope's conduct appeared a defiance; and as a
defiance he accepted it. In vain Fisher declared that he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
not sought his ill-timed honours, and would not accept them. Neither his ignorance nor
his refusal could avail him. Once more he was called upon to submit, with
the intimation, that if he refused he must bear the consequences. His reply
<span class="sidenote">June 17. He is tried at Westminster,</span>
remained what it had been; and on the 17th of June he was
taken<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> down
in a boat to Westminster Hall, where the special commission was sitting.
The proceedings at his trial are thus briefly summed up in the official
record:&mdash;"Thursday after the feast of St. Barnabas, John Fisher was brought
to the bar by Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower. Pleads not
<span class="sidenote">And is condemned.</span>
guilty. Venire awarded. Verdict&mdash;guilty. Judgment as usual in cases of
treason."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>It was a swift sentence, and swiftly to be executed. Five days were allowed
him to prepare himself; and the more austere features of the penalty were
remitted with some show of pity. He was to die by the axe.</p>

<p>Mercy was not to be hoped for. It does not seem to have been sought. He was
past eighty. The earth on the edge of the grave was already crumbling under
his feet; and death had little to make it fearful. When the last morning
dawned, he dressed himself carefully&mdash;as he said, for his marriage-day. The
<span class="sidenote">June 22. He is beheaded on Tower Hill.</span>
distance to Tower Hill was short. He was able to walk; and he tottered out
of the prison-gates, holding in his hand a closed volume of the New
Testament. The crowd flocked about him, and he was heard to pray that, as
this book had been his best comfort and companion, so in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> hour it
might give him some special strength, and speak to him as from his Lord.
Then opening it at a venture, he read: "This is life eternal, to know Thee,
the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent." It was the
answer to his prayer; and he continued to repeat the words as he was led
forward. On the scaffold he chanted the <i>Te Deum</i>, and then, after a few
prayers, knelt down, and meekly laid his head upon a pillow where neither
care nor fear nor sickness would ever vex it more. Many a spectacle of
sorrow had been witnessed on that tragic spot, but never one more sad than
this; never one more painful to think or speak of. When a nation is in the
throes of revolution, wild spirits are abroad in the storm; and poor human
nature presses blindly forward with the burden which is laid upon it,
tossing aside the obstacles in its path with a recklessness which, in
calmer hours, it would fear to contemplate.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More followed, his fortunes linked in death as in life to those
of his friend. He was left to the last&mdash;in the hope, perhaps, that the
example might produce an effect which persuasion could not. But the
example, if that was the object, worked to far other purpose. From More's
high-tempered nature, such terrors fell harmless, as from enchanted armour.
Death to him was but a passing from one country to another; and he had all
along anticipated that his prison was the antechamber of the scaffold. He
had, indeed, taken no pains to avoid it. The king, according to the
unsuspicious evidence of his daughter, Margaret Roper, had not accused him
without cause of exciting a spirit of resistance. He had spent his time in
encouraging Catholics to persevere to martyrdom for their faith. In his
many conversations with herself, he had expressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
himself with all freedom, and to others he had doubtless spoken as plainly as
to her.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>On the 7th of May he was examined by the same persons who examined Fisher;
and he was interrogated again and again in subsequent interviews. His
humour did not allow him to answer questions directly: he played with his
catechists, and did not readily furnish them with materials for a charge.
He had corresponded with Fisher in prison, on the conduct which he meant to
pursue. Some of these letters had been burnt; but others were in the hands
of the government, and would have been sufficient to sustain the
<span class="sidenote">June 26. A true bill found against Sir Thomas More.<br /><br />
July 1. He is brought to the bar.</span>
prosecution, but they preferred his own words from his own lips. At length
sufficient evidence was obtained. On the 26th of June, a true bill was
found against him by the Grand Jury of Middlesex; and on the 1st of July
the High Commission sat again in Westminster Hall, to try the most
illustrious prisoner who ever listened to his sentence
there.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> He
walked from the Tower&mdash;feebly, however, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
a stick, for he was weak
from long confinement. On appearing at the bar, a chair was brought for
him, and he was allowed to sit. The indictment was then read by the
attorney-general. It set forth that Sir Thomas More, traitorously imagining
and attempting to deprive the king of his title as supreme Head of the
Church, did, on the 7th of May, when examined before Thomas Cromwell, the
king's principal secretary, and divers other persons, whether he would
accept the king as Head on earth of the Church of England, pursuant to the
statute, refuse to give a direct answer, but replied, "I will not meddle
with any such matters, for I am fully determined to serve God and to think
upon His passion, and my passage out of this
world."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Substance of the indictment.</span>
He was then
charged with having written to Fisher that "The act of parliament was like
a sword with two edges; for if a man answered one way it would confound his
soul, and if the other way it would confound his
body."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Finally and
chiefly, he had spoken treasonable words in the Tower to Rich, the
solicitor-general. Rich had endeavoured to persuade him, as Cranmer had
endeavoured in his previous difficulty at Lambeth, that it was his duty as
a subject to obey the law of the land. "Supposing it was enacted by act of
parliament," the solicitor-general had said, "that I, Richard Rich, should
be king, and that it should be treason to deny it, what would be the
offence if you, Sir Thomas More, were to say that I was king?" More had
answered that, in his conscience, he would be bound by the act of
parliament, and would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> obliged to accept Rich as king. He would put
another case, however. "Suppose it should be enacted by parliament, <i>quod
Deus non esset Deus</i>, and that opposing the act should be treason, if it
were asked of him, Richard Rich, whether he would say <i>Quod Deus non erat
Deus</i>, according to this statute, and if he were to say No, would he not
offend?" Rich had replied, "Certainly, because it is impossible, <i>quod Deus
non esset Deus</i>; but why, Master More, can you not accept the king as chief
Head of the Church of England, just as you would that I should be made
king, in which case you agree that you would be obliged to acknowledge me
as king?" "To which More, persevering in his treasons, had answered to
Rich, that the cases were not similar, because the king could be made by
parliament and deprived by parliament;<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> but in the first case the
subject could not be obliged, because his consent could not be given for
that in parliament."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The chancellor urges him to submit.</div>

<p>This was the substance of the indictment. As soon as it was read, the lord
chancellor rose, and told the prisoner that he saw how grievously he had
offended the king; it was not too late to ask for mercy, however, which his
Majesty desired to show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He trusts, however, to remain in his opinion till death.</div>

<p>"My lord," More replied, "I have great cause to thank your honour for your
courtesy, but I beseech Almighty God that I may continue in the mind that I
am in through His grace unto death." To the charges against him he pleaded
"not guilty," and answered them at length. He could not say indeed that the
facts were not true; for although he denied that he had "practised" against
the supremacy, he could not say that he had consented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> to it, or that he
ever would consent; but like the Prior of the Charterhouse, he could not
<span class="sidenote">The jury find a verdict of guilty.</span>
admit himself guilty when he had only obeyed his conscience. The jury
retired to consider, and in a quarter of an hour returned with their
verdict. The chancellor, after receiving it, put the usual question, what
the prisoner could say in arrest of judgment. More replied, but replied
with a plea which it was impossible to recognise, by denouncing the statute
under which he was tried, and insisting on the obligation of obedience to
the see of Rome. Thus the sentence was inevitable. It was pronounced in the
ordinary form; but the usual punishment for treason was commuted, as it had
been with Fisher, to death upon the scaffold; and this last favour was
communicated as a special instance of the royal clemency. More's wit was
always ready. "God forbid," he answered, "that the king should show any
more such mercy unto any of my friends; and God bless all my posterity from
such pardons."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>The pageant was over, for such a trial was little more. As the procession
formed to lead back the "condemned traitor" to the Tower, the commissioners
once more adjured him to have pity on himself, and offered to reopen the
court if he would reconsider his resolution. More smiled, and replied only
a few words of graceful farewell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His last words to the commission.</div>

<p>"My lords," he said, "I have but to say that, like as the blessed Apostle
St. Paul was present at the death of the martyr Stephen, keeping their
clothes that stoned him, and yet they be now both saints in heaven, and
there shall continue friends for ever, so I trust, and shall therefore
pray, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> though your lordships have been on earth my judges, yet we may
hereafter meet in heaven together to our everlasting salvation; and God
preserve you all, especially my sovereign lord the king, and grant him
faithful councillors."</p>

<div class="sidenote">He returns to the Tower.<br /><br /><br />
Margaret Roper.</div>

<p>He then left the hall, and to spare him the exertion of the walk he was
allowed to return by water. At the Tower stairs one of those scenes
occurred which have cast so rich a pathos round the closing story of this
illustrious man. "When Sir Thomas," writes the grandson, "was now come to
the Tower wharf, his best beloved child, my aunt Roper, desirous to see her
father, whom she feared she should never see in this world after, to have
his last blessing, gave there attendance to meet him; whom as soon as she
had espied she ran hastily unto him, and without consideration or care for
herself, passing through the midst of the throng and guard of men, who with
bills and halberts compassed him round, there openly in the sight of them
all embraced him, and took him about the neck and kissed him, not able to
say any word but 'Oh, my father! oh, my father!' He, liking well her most
natural and dear affection towards him, gave her his fatherly blessing;
telling her that whatsoever he should suffer, though he were innocent, yet
it was not without the will of God; and that He knew well enough all the
secrets of her heart, counselling her to accommodate her will to God's
blessed pleasure, and to be patient for his loss.</p>

<p>"She was no sooner parted from him, and had gone scarce ten steps, when
she, not satisfied with the former farewell, like one who had forgot
herself, ravished with the entire love of so worthy a father, having
neither respect to herself nor to the press of people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> about him, suddenly
turned back, and ran hastily to him, and took him about the neck and divers
times together kissed him; whereat he spoke not a word, but carrying still
his gravity, tears fell also from his eyes; yea, there were very few in all
the troop who could refrain hereat from weeping, no, not the guard
themselves. Yet at last with a full heart she was severed from him, at
which time another of our women embraced him; and my aunt's maid Dorothy
Collis did the like, of whom he said after, it was homely but very lovingly
done. All these and also my grandfather witnessed that they smelt a most
odoriferous smell to come from him, according to that of Isaac, 'The scent
of my son is as the scent of a field which the Lord has blessed.'"<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The last days in the Tower.</div>

<p>More's relation with this daughter forms the most beautiful feature in his
history. His letters to her in early life are of unequalled grace, and she
was perhaps the only person whom he very deeply loved. He never saw her
again. The four days which remained to him he spent in prayer and in severe
bodily discipline. On the night of the 5th of July, although he did not
know the time which had been fixed for his execution, yet with an
instinctive feeling that it was near, he sent her his hair shirt and whip,
as having no more need for them, with a parting blessing of affection.</p>

<p>He then lay down and slept quietly. At daybreak he was awoke by the
entrance of Sir Thomas Pope, who had come to confirm his anticipations, and
to tell him it was the king's pleasure that he should suffer at nine
o'clock that morning. He received the news with utter composure. "I am much
bounden to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> king," he said, "for the benefits and honours he has
bestowed upon me; and so help me God, most of all am I bounden to him that
it pleaseth his Majesty to rid me so shortly out of the miseries of this
present world."</p>

<p>Pope told him the king desired that he would not "use many words on the
scaffold." "Mr. Pope," he answered, "you do well to give me warning, for
otherwise I had purposed somewhat to have spoken; but no matter wherewith
his Grace should have cause to be offended. Howbeit, whatever I intended, I
shall obey his Highness's command."</p>

<p>He afterwards discussed the arrangements for his funeral, at which he
begged that his family might be present; and when all was settled, Pope
rose to leave him. He was an old friend. He took More's hand and wrung it,
and quite overcome, burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Quiet yourself, Mr. Pope," More said, "and be not discomforted, for I
trust we shall once see each other full merrily, when we shall live and
love together in eternal bliss."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>As soon as he was alone he dressed in his most elaborate costume. It was
for the benefit, he said, of the executioner who was to do him so great a
service. Sir William Kingston remonstrated, and with some difficulty
induced him to put on a plainer suit; but that his intended liberality
should not fail, he sent the man a gold angel in compensation, "as a token
that he maliced him nothing, but rather loved him extremely."</p>

<div class="sidenote">He leaves the Tower.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
"So about nine of the clock he was brought by the Lieutenant out of the
Tower, his beard being long, which fashion he had never before used, his
face pale and lean, carrying in his hands a red cross, casting his eyes
often towards heaven." He had been unpopular as a judge, and one or two
persons in the crowd were insolent to him; but the distance was short and
soon over, as all else was nearly over now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the scaffold.</div>

<p>The scaffold had been awkwardly erected, and shook as he placed his foot
upon the ladder. "See me safe up," he said to Kingston. "For my coming down
I can shift for myself." He began to speak to the people, but the sheriff
begged him not to proceed, and he contented himself with asking for their
prayers, and desiring them to bear witness for him that he died in the
faith of the holy Catholic church, and a faithful servant of God and the
king. He then repeated the Miserere psalm on his knees; and when he had
ended and had risen, the executioner, with an emotion which promised ill
for the manner in which his part in the tragedy would be accomplished,
begged his forgiveness. More kissed him. "Thou art to do me the greatest
benefit that I can receive," he said. "Pluck up thy spirit, man, and be not
afraid to do thine office. My neck is very short. Take heed therefore that
thou strike not awry for saving of thine honesty." The executioner offered
to tie his eyes. "I will cover them myself," he said; and binding them in a
cloth which he had brought with him, he knelt and laid his head upon the
block. The fatal stroke was about to fall, when he signed for a moment's
delay while he moved aside his beard. "Pity that should be cut," he
murmured, "that has not committed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
treason." With which strange words, the<span class="sidenote">Death.</span>
strangest perhaps ever uttered at such a time, the lips most famous through
Europe for eloquence and wisdom closed for ever.</p>

<p>"So," concludes his biographer, "with alacrity and spiritual joy he
received the fatal axe, which no sooner had severed the head from the body,
but his soul was carried by angels into everlasting glory, where a crown of
martyrdom was placed upon him which can never fade nor decay; and then he
found those words true which he had often spoken, that a man may lose his
head and have no harm."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>This was the execution of Sir Thomas More, an act which was sounded out
into the far corners of the earth, and was the world's wonder as well for
the circumstances under which it was perpetrated, as for the preternatural
composure with which it was borne. Something of his calmness may have been
due to his natural temperament, something to an unaffected weariness of a
world which in his eyes was plunging into the ruin of the latter days. But
those fair hues of sunny cheerfulness caught their colour from the
simplicity of his faith; and never was there a Christian's victory over
death more grandly evidenced than in that last scene lighted with its
lambent humour.</p>

<p>History will rather dwell upon the incidents of the execution than attempt
a sentence upon those who willed that it should be. It was at once most
piteous and most inevitable. The hour of retribution had come at length,
when at the hands of the Roman church was to be required all the righteous
blood which it had shed, from the blood of Raymond of Toulouse to the blood
of the last victim who had blackened into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> ashes at Smithfield. The voices
crying underneath the altar had been heard upon the throne of the Most
High, and woe to the generation of which the dark account had been
demanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The effect of these executions in Europe.</div>

<p>In whatever light, however, we may now think of these things, the effect in
Europe was instantaneous and electrical. The irritation which had
accompanied the excommunication by Clement had died away in the difficulty
of executing the censures. The papal party had endeavoured to persuade
themselves that the king was acting under a passing caprice. They had
believed that the body of the people remained essentially Catholic; and
they had trusted to time, to discontent, to mutiny, to the consequences of
what they chose to regard as the mere indulgence of criminal passion, to
bring Henry to his senses. To threats and anathemas, therefore, had again
succeeded fair words and promises, and intrigues and flatteries; and the
pope and his advisers, so long accustomed themselves to promise and to mean
nothing, to fulminate censures in form, and to treat human life as a
foolish farce upon the stage, had dreamed that others were like themselves.
In the rough awakening out of their delusion, as with a stroke of
lightning, popes, cardinals, kings, emperors, ambassadors, were startled
into seriousness; and, the diplomatic meshwork all rent and broken, they
fell at once each into their places, with a sense suddenly forced upon them
that it was no child's play any longer. The King of England was in earnest,
it seemed. The assumption of the supremacy was a fixed purpose, which he
was prepared to make a question of life and death; and with this resolution
they must thenceforward make their account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The news arrives at Rome of the deaths of the Carthusians.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
On the 1st of June, Cassalis wrote<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> from Rome that the French
ambassador had received a letter concerning certain friars who had been put
to death in England for denying the king to be Head of the Church. The
letter had been read in the consistory, and was reported to be written in a
tone of the deepest commiseration. There had been much conversation about
it, the French bishops having been louder than any in their denunciations;
and the form of the execution was described as having been most barbarous.
Some of the cardinals had said that they envied the monks their deaths in
such a cause, and wished that they had been with them. "I desired my
informant," Cassalis said, "to suggest to these cardinals, that, if they
were so anxious on the subject, they had better pay a visit to England."
And he concluded, in cipher, "I cannot tell very well what to think of the
French. An Italian told me he had heard the Most Christian king himself
say, that although he was obliged to press upon the pope the requests of
the king of England, yet that these requests were preposterous, and could
not be granted."</p>

<div class="sidenote">And of Fisher, which the pope will make of more account than the
martyrdom of Becket.</div>

<p>The deaths of a few poor monks would soon have been forgiven; the execution
of Fisher first really revealed the truth. No sooner was the terrible reply
of Henry to his promotion to the cardinalate made known than the conclave
was instantly summoned. Cardinal Tournon described the scene upon the
scaffold in language which moved all his audience to tears.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The pope,
in a paroxysm of anger, declared that if he had seen his own nephews
murdered in his presence, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> would not have so much affected him; and
Cassalis said he heard, from good authority, that they would do their
worst, and intended to make the Bishop of Rochester's death of more account
than that of the martyr St. Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">All Europe unites in amazed displeasure.<br /><br />
Francis remonstrates, and recommends that in future political
offenders should be banished.</div>

<p>Nor was the anger or the surprise confined to Rome. Through England,
through France, through Flanders, even among the Protestants of Germany,
there rose a simultaneous outcry of astonishment. Rumour flew to and fro
with a thousand falsehoods; and the unfortunate leaven of the Anne Boleyn
marriage told fatally to destroy that appearance of probity of motive so
indispensable to the defence of the government. Even Francis I. forgot his
caution, and dared to remonstrate. He wrote to entreat his good brother in
future to content himself for the future with banishing such offenders, and
sparing the extremity of his penalties.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the question which was at issue was European as well as
English; and every exile who was driven from England would have become,
like Reginald Pole, a missionary of a holy war against the infidel king.
Whatever else might have been possible, banishment was more perilous than
pardon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry condescends to explanation.</div>

<p>But the indignation was so general and so serious, that Henry thought it
well to offer an explanation of his conduct, both at home and abroad. With
his own people he communicated through the lay authorities, not choosing to
trust himself on this occasion to the clergy. The magistrates at the
quarter sessions were directed "to declare to the people the treasons
committed by the late Bishop of Rochester
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> and Sir Thomas More; who
thereby, and by divers secret practices, of their malicious minds intended
to seminate, engender, and breed a most mischievous and seditious opinion,
not only to their own confusion, but also of divers others, who have lately
suffered execution according to their demerits."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> To Francis, Cromwell
instructed Gardiner, who was ambassador in Paris, to reply very haughtily.
<span class="sidenote">His message to Francis.<br /><br />
He had made his laws on good and substantial grounds,</span>
The English government, he said had acted on clear proof of treason;
treason so manifest, and tending so clearly to the total destruction of the
commonwealth of the realm, that the condemned persons "were well worthy, if
they had a thousand lives, to have suffered ten times a more terrible death
and execution than any of them did suffer." The laws which the king had
made were "not without substantial grounds;" but had been passed "by great
and mature advice, counsel, and deliberation of the whole policy of the
realm, and" were "indeed no new laws, but of great antiquity, now renovate
and renewed in respect to the common weal of the same realm."</p>

<div class="sidenote">And is much surprised that he should be advised to banish his
traitors, giving them increased opportunity to injure him.</div>

<p>With respect to the letter of the King of France, Gardiner was to say, it
was "not a little to his Highness's marvel that the French king would ever
counsel or advise him, if in case hereafter any such like offenders should
happen to be in the realm, that he should rather banish them, than in such
wise execute them, ... supposing it to be neither the office of a friend
nor a brother, that he would counsel the King's High<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>ness to banish his
traitors into strange parts, where they might have good occasion, time,
place, and opportunity to work their feats of treason and conspiracy the
better against the king and this his realm. In which part," concluded
Cromwell, "ye shall somewhat engrieve the matter, after such sort that it
may well appear to the French king that the King's Highness may take those
his counsels both strangely and unkindly."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His elaborate despatch to Cassalis intended for the pope.</div>

<p>With the German princes Henry was scarcely less imperious;<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> and it is
noteworthy that the most elaborate defence which he condescended to make is
that which was sent to Sir Gregory Cassalis, to be laid before the pope. He
chose that the Roman court should understand distinctly the grounds on
which he had acted; and this despatch (which was written by Cromwell) shows
more clearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> than any other state paper which remains to us, the light in
which the reforming party desired their conduct to be regarded.</p>

<p>It was written in reply to the letter in which Cassalis reported the
irritation of the Roman court, and enters into the whole ground of
complaint against More and Fisher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He cannot sufficiently marvel at the pope's displeasure.</div>

<p>"I have signified," wrote Cromwell, "to the King's Highness the purport of
your late letters, and as they contained many things which were very
welcome to his Majesty, so he could not sufficiently marvel that the pope
should have conceived so great offence at the deaths of the Bishop of
Rochester and Sir Thomas More. And albeit his Majesty is not bound to
render account of his actions except to God, whom in thought and deed he is
ever desirous to obey; nevertheless that his royal name may not be evil
spoken of by malicious tongues, from want of knowledge of the truth, I will
tell you briefly what has been done in this matter.</p>

<p>"After that his Majesty, with the favour and assistance of Almighty God,
had brought his cause to an end, by the consent and authority of
unprejudiced persons of the most approved learning in Christendom,&mdash;and
after he had confirmed it by the very rule of truth, these men, who had
looked to see a far different conclusion, finding now no hopes of
<span class="sidenote">Fisher and More had obstructed the reforms which had been
introduced into the realm.</span>
disturbing the settlement thus made, began to meditate other purposes. And
when our good king, according to his princely duty, was devising measures
for the quiet and good order of the realm, and for the correction of
manners now largely fallen to decay, this, so great a benefit to the
commonweal, they did, so far as in them lay, endeavour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> though without
effect, under pretence of dissembled honesty, to obstruct and oppose.
Manifest proofs of their wicked designs were in the hands of the King's
Grace; but his Majesty consented rather to pass over their offence without
notice, hoping to recall them to a better mind, as having before been in
some good estimation with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They had thwarted the measures in progress through parliament,</div>

<p>"But they in whom ambition, love of self, and a peculiar conceit of wisdom
had bred another persuasion, obstinately abused this kindness of their most
noble prince. And when on a certain day there was order issued for the
assembly of the great council of the realm, they made secret inquiry to
learn the measures which would there be treated of. Whatsoever they
discovered or conjectured, forthwith they debated in private council among
themselves, arriving upon each point at conclusions other than those which
the interests of the realm did require; and they fortified those
conclusions with such array of arguments and reasons, that with no great
labour the ignorant people might have been dangerously deceived.</p>

<p>"At length knowing that they had incurred the king's displeasure, and
fearing lest they might fail of accomplishing their purposes, they chose
out persons on whose courage, readiness, and devotion to themselves they
could depend; and taking these men into their councils, they fed them with
the poison which they had conceived, forgetting their allegiance to their
king, and their duty to their
<span class="sidenote">And had organized seditious opposition in the country.</span>
country.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
Thus were their seditious
opinions scattered over the country. And when his Highness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> began to trace
this impious conspiracy to its source, Sir Thomas More and the Bishop of
Rochester were found to be the undoubted authors of the same; and their
guilt was proved against them by the evidence of their own handwrit, and
the confessions of their own lips. For these causes, therefore, and for
many others of like kind, our most gracious sovereign was compelled to
imprison them as rebellious subjects, as disturbers of the public peace,
and as movers of sedition and tumult. Nor was it possible for him to do
<span class="sidenote">They had in consequence been committed to the Tower, where they
were treated with the utmost kindness.<br /><br />
Kindness had, however, produced no effect; they had continued to
obstruct the government; and had therefore been tried and condemned by the
ordinary laws of the realm.</span>
other than punish them, unless, after their crimes had been detected, he
had so far forgotten his duty as to leave the contagion to spread
unchecked, to the utter destruction of the nation. They were in consequence
thrown into the Tower, where, however, their treatment was far different
from what their demerits had deserved; they were allowed the society of
their friends; their own servants were admitted to attend upon them, and
they received all such indulgences in food and dress as their families
desired. Clemency, however, produced no effect on persons in whom duty and
allegiance had given place to treason and malice. They chose rather to
persist in their wicked courses than to make trial by repentance of the
king's goodness. For after that certain laws had been decreed by authority
of parliament, and had been by the whole nation admitted and accepted as
expedient for the realm, and agreeable to true religion, they alone refused
their consent to these laws, hoping that something might occur to sustain
them in their impiety; and while professing to have left all care and
thought for human things, they were considering by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> what arguments, in
furtherance of their seditious purposes, they might, to the common hurt,
elude, refute, and disturb the said laws.</p>

<p>"Of this their treason there are proofs extant&mdash;letters written, when ink
failed them, with chalk or charcoal, and passed secretly from one to the
other. Our most merciful king could therefore no longer tolerate their
grievous faults. He allowed them to be tried by process of ordinary law.
They were found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to death. Their
punishment was milder than that which the law prescribed, or which their
crimes had deserved; and many persons have by this example been brought to
a better mind."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>To Cromwell evidently the case appeared so clear as to require no apology.
To modern writers it has appeared so clear as to admit of none. The value
of the defence turns upon the point of the actual danger to the state, and
the extent to which the conduct of the sufferers imperilled the progress of
the Reformation. As written for the eyes of the pope and cardinals,
however, such a letter could be understood only as daring them to do their
worst. It ignored the very existence of such rules of judgment as the heads
of the Roman church would alone acknowledge, and represented the story as
it appeared from the position which England had assumed on its revolt from
its old allegiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reply of the pope.</div>

<p>There were no more false efforts at conciliation, and open war thenceforth
appeared to be the only possible relation between the papacy and Henry
VIII. Paul III. replied, or designed to reply, with his far-famed bull of
interdict and deposition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> which, though reserved at the moment in
deference to Francis of France, and not issued till three years later, was
composed in the first burst of his displeasure.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The substance of his
voluminous anathemas may be thus briefly epitomized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bull of interdict and deposition.</div>

<p>The pope, quoting and applying to himself the words of Jeremiah, "Behold, I
have set thee over nations and kingdoms, that thou mayest root out and
destroy, and that thou mayest plant and build again," addressed Henry as a
disobedient vassal. Already lying under the censures of the church, he had
gone on to heap crime on crime; and therefore, a specific number of days
being allowed him to repent and make his submission, at the expiration of
this period of respite the following sentence was to take effect.</p>

<p>The king, with all who abetted him in his crimes, was pronounced
accursed&mdash;cut off from the body of Christ, to perish. When he died, his
body should lie without burial; his soul, blasted with anathema, should be
cast into hell for ever. The lands of his subjects who remained faithful to
him were laid under an interdict: their children were disinherited, their
marriages illegal, their wills invalid; only by one condition could they
escape their fate&mdash;by instant rebellion against the apostate prince. All
officers of the crown were absolved from their oaths; all subjects, secular
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> ecclesiastic, from their allegiance. The entire nation, under penalty
of excommunication, was commanded no longer to acknowledge Henry as their
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> No true son of the church should hold intercourse with him
or his adherents. They must neither trade with them, speak with them, nor
give them food. The clergy, leaving behind a few of their number to baptize
the new-born infants, were to withdraw from the accursed land, and return
no more till it had submitted. If the king, trusting to force, persevered
in his iniquity, the lords and commons of England, dukes, marquises, earls,
and all other persons, were required, under the same penalty of
excommunication, to expel him from the throne; and the Christian princes of
Europe were called on to show their fidelity to the Holy See, by aiding in
so godly a work.</p>

<p>In conclusion, as the king had commanded his clergy to preach against the
pope in their churches, so the pope commanded them to retaliate upon the
king, and with bell, book, and candle declare him cursed.</p>

<p>This was loud thunder; nor, when abetted by Irish massacres and English
treasons, was it altogether impotent. If Henry's conceptions of the royal
supremacy were something imperious, the papal supremacy was not more modest
in its self-assertion; and the language of Paul III. went far to justify
the rough measures by which his menaces were parried. If any misgiving had
remained in the king's mind on the legitimacy of the course which he had
pursued, the last trace of it must have been obliterated by the perusal of
this preposterous bombast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peril of Henry's position.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
For the moment, as I said, the bull was suspended through the interference
of Francis. But Francis remained in communion with the See of Rome: Francis
was at that moment labouring to persuade the Lutheran states in Germany to
return to communion with it: and Henry knew, that, although in their hearts
the European powers might estimate the pope's pretences at their true
value, yet the bull of excommunication might furnish a convenient and
dangerous pretext against him in the event of a Catholic combination. His
position was full of peril; and in spite of himself, he was driven once
more to seek for an alliance among the foreign Protestants, before the
French intrigues should finally anticipate him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues of the French in Germany.</div>

<p>That he really might be too late appeared an immediate likelihood. The
quarrel between the Lutherans and the followers of Zwingli, the Anabaptist
anarchy and the increasing confusion throughout the Protestant states, had
so weighed on Luther's spirit that he was looking for the end of all things
and the coming of Christ; and although Luther himself never quailed, too
many "murmurers in the wilderness" were looking wistfully back into Egypt.
The French king, availing himself skilfully of the turning tide, had sent
the Bishop of Paris to the courts of Saxony and Bavaria, in the beginning
of August, to feel his way towards a reconciliation; and his efforts had
been attended with remarkable success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probability of a reconciliation of the Lutherans with the See of
Rome.</div>

<p>The bishop had been in communication with Melancthon and many of the
leading Lutheran theologians upon the terms on which they would return to
the church. The Protestant divines had drawn up a series of articles, the
first of which was a profession of readiness to recog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>nise the authority of
the pope;<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
accompanying this statement with a declaration that they
would accept any terms not plainly unjust and impious. These articles were
transmitted to Paris, and again retransmitted to Germany, with every
prospect of a mutually satisfactory result; and Melancthon was waiting only
till the bishop could accompany him, to go in person to Paris, and consult
with the Sorbonne.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Of which Henry is partly the cause.</div>

<p>This momentary (for it was only momentary) weakness of the German
Protestants was in part owing to their want of confidence in Henry
VIII.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
The king had learnt to entertain a respect for the foreign
Reformers, far unlike the repugnance of earlier years; but the prospect of
an alliance with them had hitherto been too much used by him as a weapon
with which to menace the Catholic powers, whose friendship he had not
concealed that he would prefer. The Protestant princes had shrunk
therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
and wisely, from allowing themselves to be made the instruments
of worldly policy; and the efforts at a combination had hitherto been
illusive and ineffectual. Danger now compelled the king to change his
hesitation into more honest advances. If Germany accepted the mediation of
Francis, and returned to communion with Rome; and if, under the
circumstances of a reunion, a general council were assembled; there could
be little doubt of the attitude in which a council, called together under
such auspices, would place itself towards the movement in England. To
<span class="sidenote">Henry is driven to conciliate the German princes.</span>
escape so imminent a peril, Henry was obliged (as Elizabeth after him) to
seek the support of a party from which he had shrunk: he was forced, in
spite of himself, to identify his cause with the true cause of freedom, and
consequently to admit an enlarged toleration of the Reformed doctrines in
his own dominions. There could be little doubt of the support of the
Germans, if they could be once assured that they would not again be trifled
with; and a Protestant league, the steady object of Cromwell's efforts,
seemed likely at length to be realized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />August. Nature of the relations of the Tudors to the German
Protestants.</div>

<p>Different indeed would have been the future, both of England and for
Germany, if such a league had been possible, if the pressure which
compelled this most natural alliance had continued till it had cemented
into rock. But the Tudors, representatives in this, as in so many other
features of their character, of the people whom they governed, could never
cordially unite themselves with a form of thought which permitted
resistance to authority, and which they regarded as anarchic and
revolutionary. They consented, when no alternative was left them, to endure
for short periods a state of doubtful cordiality;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> but the connexion was
terminated at the earliest moment which safety permitted; in their hatred
of disorder (for this feeling is the key alike to the strength and to the
weakness of the Tudor family), they preferred the incongruities of
Anglicanism to a complete reformation; and a "midge-madge"<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> of
contradictory formularies to the simplicity of the Protestant faith. In
essentials, the English movement was political rather than spiritual. What
was gained for the faith, we owe first to Providence, and then to those
accidents, one of which had now arisen, which compelled at intervals a
<span class="sidenote">Mission of the Bishop of Hereford to counteract the French.</span>
deeper and a broader policy. To counteract the French emissaries,
Christopher Mount, in August, and in September, Fox, Bishop of Hereford,
were despatched to warn the Lutheran princes against their intrigues, and
to point out the course which the interests of Northern Europe in the
existing conjuncture required. The bishop's instructions were drawn by the
king. He was to proceed direct to the court of Saxony, and, after
presenting his letters of credit, was to address the elector to the
following effect:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry's message to the Elector of Saxony.</div>

<p>"Besides and beyond the love, amity, and friendship which noble blood and
progeny had carnally caused and continued in the heart of the King's
Highness towards the said duke and his progenitors, and besides that
kindness also which of late by mutual communication of gratuities had been
not a little augmented and increased between them, there was also stirred
up in the heart of the King's Highness a spiritual love and favour towards
the said duke and his virtuous intents and proceedings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> for that the said
duke persisted and continued in his most virtuous mind to set forth,
maintain, and defend the sincere teaching of the gospel and the perfect
<span class="sidenote">He desires, in connexion with other princes who have the same
cause at heart, to maintain the middle way of truth, according to God's
word.</span>
true understanding of the word of God. In that matter the King's Highness,
also illuminated with the same spirit of truth, and wholly addict and
dedicate to the advancement thereof, had employed great pain and travail to
bring the same to the knowledge of his people and subjects, intending also
further and further to proceed therein, as his Grace by good consultation
should perceive might tend to the augmentation of the glory of God and the
true knowledge of his word. His said Majesty was of such sincere meaning in
the advancing [hereof] as his Grace would neither headily, without good
advisement, and consultation, and conference with his friends, go in any
part beyond the said truth, ne for any respect tarry or stay on this side
the truth, but would proceed in the right straight mean way assuredly
agreed upon. He had known of certainty divers who by their immoderate zeal
or the excessive appetite to novelties had from darkness proceeded to much
<span class="sidenote">September. He has heard that the Lutherans are again inclining
to Rome; and he desires to know their true intentions.</span>
more darkness, wherein the Anabaptists and sacramentarians were guilty; so
by secret report he had been advertised, that upon private communications
and conferences, the learned men there [in Germany] had in certain points
and articles yielded and relented from their first asseveration; by reason
whereof it was much doubted whether by other degrees they might be
dissuaded in some of the rest. The King's Highness therefore, being very
desirous to know the truth therein, and to be ascertained in what points
and articles the learned men there were so assuredly and constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
resolved as by no persuasion of man they could be turned from the same, had
sent the Bishop of Hereford to the said duke, desiring and praying him in
respect of the premises to entertain the said bishop friendly and
familiarly concerning the matter aforesaid, as the mutual love carnally,
and the zeal of both princes to the increase of the glory of God
spiritually, did require."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He dissuades a council.</div>

<p>The bishop was then to speak of the council, the assembling of which he
understood that the German princes so much desired. He was to dissuade them
from pressing it, to the extent of his ability. They would find themselves
opposed inevitably in all essential matters by the pope, the emperor, and
the French king, whose factions united would outnumber and outvote them;
and in the existing state of Europe, a general council would only
<span class="sidenote">But if a council is to meet, let them come to a common
understanding with England.</span>
compromise their position and embarrass their movements. If, however,
notwithstanding his remonstrances, the princes persisted in their wish,
then the bishop was to urge them to come to some understanding with England
on the resolutions which they desired to maintain. Let them communicate to
the English bishops such points "as they would stick to without relenting;"
and the two countries, "standing together, would be so much stronger to
withstand their adversaries." Without definitely promising to sign the
Confession of Augsburg, Henry held out strong hopes that he might sign that
Confession, if they would send representatives to London to discuss the
articles of it with himself.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
The bishop was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">The bishop was to apologize for all past coolness,</span>
to apologize for any
previous slackness on the king's part in his communications with the
elector, and to express his hopes, that for the future their relations
might be those of cordial unanimity. He was especially to warn the elector
to beware of re-admitting the papal supremacy under any pretext. The
English had shaken off the pope, "provoked thereunto in such wise as would
have provoked them rather to have expelled him from them by wrong, than to
<span class="sidenote">And to conclude with fresh warnings against the pope.</span>
suffer him so to oppress them with injuries." If in Germany they "opened
the great gate" to let him in again, he would rebuild "the fortresses that
were thrown down, and by little and little bring all to the former estate
again." Finally, with respect to the council&mdash;if a council there was to
be&mdash;they must take care that it was held in a place indifferent, where
truth might be heard or spoken; "considering that else in a council, were
not the remedy that all good men sought, but the mischief that all good men
did abhor."</p>

<p>These advances, consented to by Henry, were the act of Cromwell, and were
designed as the commencement of a <i>F&oelig;dus Evangelicum</i>&mdash;a league of the
great Reforming nations of Europe. It was a grand scheme, and history can
never cease to regret that it was grasped at with too faint a hand. The
bishop succeeded in neutralizing partially the scheming of the French,
partially in attracting the sympathies of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> German powers towards
England; but the two great streams of the Teutonic race, though separated
by but a narrow ridge of difference, were unable to reach a common channel.
Their genius drove them into courses which were to run side by side for
centuries, yet ever to remain divided. And if the lines in which their
minds have flowed seem to be converging at last, and if hereafter Germans
and English are again to unite in a single faith, the remote meeting point
is still invisible, and the terms of possible agreement can be but faintly
conjectured.</p>

one of the most obscure passages in the history of this reign. It was a
Welsh plot, conducted at Islington. [Act of Attainder of Richard ap

discover further, than that it was a desperate undertaking, encouraged by
the uncertainty of the succession, and by a faith in prophecies (Confession
of Sir William Neville: <i>Rolls House MS.</i>), to murder the king. Ryce was
tried in Michaelmas term, 1531, and executed. His uncle, who passed under

drawn up by the government at the time of the passing of the act, which is
highly curious and significant. "The King's Grace," says this paper, "hath
no new authority given hereby that he is recognised as supreme Head of the
Church of England; for in that recognition is included only that he have
such power as to a king of right appertaineth by the law of God; and not
that he should take any spiritual power from spiritual ministers that is
given to them by the Gospel. So that these words, that the king is supreme
Head of the Church, serve rather to declare and make open to the world,
that the king hath power to suppress all such extorted powers as well of
the Bishop of Rome as of any other within this realm, whereby his subjects
might be grieved; and to correct and remove all things whereby any
unquietness might arise amongst the people; rather than to prove that he
should pretend thereby to take any powers from the successors of the
apostles that was given to them by God. And forasmuch as, in the session of
this former parliament holden in the twenty-fifth year of this reign,
whereby great exactions done to the king's subjects by a power from Rome
was put away, and thereupon the promise was made that nothing should be
interpreted and expounded upon that statute, that the King's Grace, his
nobles or subjects, intended to decline or vary from the congregation of
Christ's church in anything concerning the articles of the Catholic faith,
or anything declared by Holy Scripture and the Word of God necessary for
his Grace's salvation and his subjects'; it is not, therefore, meet lightly
to think that the self-same persons, continuing the self-same parliament,
would in the next year following make an act whereby the king, his nobles
and subjects, should so vary. And no man may with conscience judge that
they did so, except they can prove that the words of the statute, whereby
the king is recognised to be the supreme Head of the Church of England,
should show expressly that they intended to do so; as it is apparent that
they do not.
</p><p>
"There is none authority of Scripture that will prove that any one of the
apostles should be head of the universal Church of Christendom. And if any
of the doctors of the church or the clergy have, by any of their laws or
decrees, declared any Scripture to be of that effect, kings and princes,
taking to them their counsellors, and such of their clergy as they shall
think most indifferent, ought to be judges whether those declarations and
laws be made according to the truth of Scripture or not; because it is said
in the Psalms, 'Et nunc Reges intelligite, erudimini qui judicatis terram':
that is, 'O kings! understand ye, be ye learned that judge the world.' And
certain it is that the Scripture is always true; and there is nothing that
the doctors and clergy might, through dread and affection, [so well] be
deceived in, as in things concerning the honour, dignity, power, liberty,
jurisdiction, and riches of the bishops and clergy; and some of them have
of likelihood been deceived therein."&mdash;Heads of Arguments concerning the

such mischiefs as God, sometime with us displeased, doth inflict and lay
upon us, or the devil, at God's permission, to assay the good and God's
elect, doth sow and set among us,&mdash;the which Almighty God and man's policy

" ... In addition, the Count de Nassau and yourself may go further in
sounding the King about the Count's proposal&mdash;I mean for the marriage of
our cousin the Princess of England with the Duke d'Angoulesme. The Grand
Master, I understand, when the Count spoke of it, seemed to enter into the
suggestion, and mentioned the displeasure which the King of England had
conceived against Anne Boleyn. I am therefore sincerely desirous that the
proposal should be well considered, and you will bring it forward as you
shall see opportunity. You will make the King and the Grand Master feel the
importance of the connexion, the greatness which it would confer on the
Duke d'Angoulesme, the release of the English debt, which can be easily
arranged, and the assurance of the realm of France.
</p><p>
"Such a marriage will be, beyond comparison, more advantageous to the King,
his realm, and his children, than any benefit for which he could hope from
Milan; while it can be brought about with no considerable difficulty. But
be careful what you say, and how you say it. Speak alone to the King and
alone to the Grand Master, letting neither of them know that you have
spoken to the other. Observe carefully how the King is inclined, and, at
all events, be secret; so that if he does not like the thing, the world
need not know that it has been thought of.
</p><p>
"Should it be suggested to you&mdash;as it may be&mdash;that Anne Boleyn may be
driven desperate, and may contrive something against the Princess's life,
we answer that we can hardly believe her so utterly abandoned by
conscience: or, again, the Duke of Anjou may possibly object to the
exaltation of his brother; in which case we shall consent willingly to have
our cousin marry the Duke of Anjou; and, in that case, beyond the right
which appertains to the Duke and Princess from their fathers and mothers,
they and either of them shall have the kingdom of Denmark, and we will
exert ourselves to compose any difficulties with our Holy Father the
Pope."&mdash;<i>MS. Archives at Brussels.</i></p></div>

Reynolds, and to one other brother of them, the copy of his said letters
directed to the King's Grace, and the copy of the king's answer also. He
hath knowledged to me also that the said Fisher sent unto them with the
said copies a book of his, made in defence of the King's Grace's first
marriage, and also Abel's book, and one other book made by the emperour's
ambassador, as I suppose."&mdash;Bedyll to Cromwell: <i>Suppression of the
Monasteries</i>, pp. 45, 46.</p></div>

exception. A letter is extant from Fisher, in which he complained of
suffering from the cold and from want of clothes. This must have been an
accident. More was evidently treated well (see More's <i>Life of More</i>); and
all the circumstances imply that they were allowed to communicate freely
with their friends, and to receive whatever comforts their friends were
pleased to send them. The official statements on this subject are too
positive and too minute to admit of a doubt. Cromwell writes thus to
Cassalis: "Carceribus mancipati tractabantur humanius atque mitius quam par
fuisset pro eorum demeritis; per Regem illis licebat proximorum colloquio
et consuetudine frui. Ii fuerant illis appositi pr&aelig;scriptique ministri quos

that no Catholic was ever punished for merely denying the supremacy in
official examinations. He has gone so far, indeed, as to call the
assertions of Catholic writers to this effect "impudent falsehoods."
Whether any Catholic was prosecuted who had not given other cause for
suspicion, I do not know; but it is quite certain that Haughton and Fisher
were condemned solely on the ground of their answers on these occasions,
and that no other evidence was brought against them. The government clearly
preferred this evidence as the most direct and unanswerable, for in both
those cases they might have produced other witnesses had they cared to do
so.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="chaptsubhead">THE VISITATION OF THE MONASTERIES.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Many</span> high interests in England had been injured by the papal jurisdiction;
but none had suffered more vitally than those of the monastic
establishments. These establishments had been injured, not by fines and
exactions,&mdash;for oppression of this kind had been terminated by the statutes
of provisors,&mdash;but because, except at rare and remote intervals, they had
been left to themselves, without interference and without surveillance.
They were deprived of those salutary checks which all human institutions
<span class="sidenote">Exemption of the religious houses from control.</span>
require if they are to be saved from sliding into corruption. The religious
houses, almost without exception, were not amenable to the authority of the
bishops. The several societies acknowledged obedience only to the heads of
their order, who resided abroad; or to the pope, or to some papal delegate.
Thus any regularly conducted visitation was all but impossible. The foreign
superiors, who were forbidden by statute to receive for their services more
than certain limited and reasonable fees, would not undertake a gratuitous
labour; and the visitations, attempted with imperfect
powers<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> by the
English archbishops, could be resisted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> successfully under pleas of
exemption and obedience to the rules of the
orders.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
Thus the abbeys
had gone their own way, careless of the gathering indignation with which
they were regarded by the people, and believing that in their position they
<span class="sidenote">Contrast in the monasteries between theory and fact.<br /><br />
The original intention.</span>
held a sacred shield which would protect them for ever. In them, as
throughout the Catholic system, the sadness of the condition into which
they had fallen was enhanced by the contrast between the theory and the
degenerate reality. Originally, and for many hundred years after their
foundation, the regular clergy were the finest body of men of which mankind
in their chequered history can boast. They lived to illustrate, in
systematic simplicity, the universal law of sacrifice. In their three chief
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, they surrendered everything which
makes life delightful. Their business on earth was to labour and to pray:
to labour for other men's bodies, to pray for other men's souls. Wealth
flowed in upon them; the world, in its instinctive loyalty to greatness,
laid its lands and its possessions at their feet; and for a time was seen
the notable spectacle of property administered as a trust, from which the
owners reaped no benefit, except increase of toil. The genius of the age
expended its highest efforts to provide fitting tabernacles for the divine
spirit which they enshrined; and alike in village and city, the majestic
houses of the Father of mankind and his especial servants towered up in
sovereign beauty, symbols of the civil supremacy of the church, and of the
moral sublimity of life and character which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> had won the homage and the
admiration of the Christian nations. Ever at the sacred gates sate Mercy,
pouring out relief from a never-failing store to the poor and the
suffering; ever within the sacred aisles the voices of holy men were
pealing heavenwards, in intercession for the sins of mankind; and
influences so blessed were thought to exhale around those mysterious
precincts, that the outcasts of society&mdash;the debtor, the felon, and the
outlaw&mdash;gathered round the walls, as the sick men sought the shadow of the
apostle, and lay there sheltered from the avenging hand till their sins
were washed from off their souls. Through the storms of war and conquest
the abbeys of the middle ages floated, like the ark upon the waves of the
flood, inviolate in the midst of violence, through the awful reverence
which surrounded them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of "religion" left it in the 14th century.</div>

<p>The soul of "religion,"<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> however, had died out of it for many
generations before the Reformation. At the close of the fourteenth century,
Wycliffe had cried that the rotting trunk cumbered the ground, and should
be cut down. It had not been cut down; it had been allowed to stand for a
hundred and fifty more years; and now it was indeed plain that it could
remain no longer. The boughs were bare, the stem was withered, the veins
were choked with corruption; the ancient life-tree of monasticism would
blossom and bear fruit no more. Faith had sunk into superstition; duty had
died into routine; and the monks, whose technical discipline was forgotten,
and who were set free by their position from the discipline of ordinary
duty, had travelled swiftly on the downhill road of human corruption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The darker scandals not to be touched upon.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
Only light reference will be made in this place to the darker scandals by
which the abbeys were dishonoured. Such things there really were, to an
extent which it may be painful to believe, but which evidence too
abundantly proves. It is better, however, to bury the recollection of the
more odious forms of human depravity; and so soon as those who condemn the
Reformation have ceased to deny what the painfulness of the subject only
has allowed to remain disputed, the sins of the last English monks will
sleep with them in their tombs. Here, in spite of such denials, the most
offensive pictures shall continue to be left in the shade; and persons who
wish to gratify their curiosity, or satisfy their unbelief, may consult the
authorities for
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Political and administrative abuses.</span>
I shall confine my own efforts rather to
the explanation of the practical, and, in the highest sense of the word,
political abuses, which, on the whole, perhaps, told most weightily on the
serious judgment of the age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The abbeys intended for the benefit of the poor.</div>

<p>The abbeys, then, as the State regarded them, existed for the benefit of
the poor. The occupants for the time being were themselves under vows of
poverty; they might appropriate to their personal use no portion of the
revenues of their estates; they were to labour with their own hands, and
administer their property for the public advantage. The surplus proceeds of
the lands, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
their own modest requirements had been supplied, were to
be devoted to the maintenance of learning, to the exercise of a liberal
hospitality, and to the relief of the aged, the impotent, and the helpless.
<span class="sidenote">Fraudulent neglect of duty.</span>
The popular clamour of the day declared that these duties were
systematically neglected; that two-thirds, at least, of the religious
bodies abused their opportunities unfairly for their own advantage; and
this at a time when the obligations of all property were defined as
strictly as its rights, and negligent lay owners were promptly corrected by
the State whenever occasion required. The monks, it was believed, lived in
idleness, keeping vast retinues of servants to do the work which they ought
to have done
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Illegal division of profits.</span>
They were accused of sharing dividends by
mutual connivance, although they were forbidden by their rule to possess
any private property whatever, and of wandering about the country in the
disguise of laymen in pursuit of forbidden
indulgences.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
They were bound by their statutes to keep their houses full, and if their means were

their complement to fall to half, and sometimes to a third, of the original

foundation, fraudulently reserving the enlarged profits to themselves. It
was thought, too, that they had racked their estates; that having a
life-interest only, they had encumbered them with debts, mortgages, and
fines; that in some cases they had wholly alienated lands, of which they
had less right to dispose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
than a modern rector of his
glebe.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
In the meantime, it was said that the poor were not fed, that hospitality was
neglected, that the buildings and houses were falling to waste, that fraud
and Simony prevailed among them from the highest to the lowest, that the
abbots sold the presentations to the benefices which were in their gift, or
dishonestly retained the cures of souls in their own hands, careless
whether the duties of the parishes could or could not be discharged; and
that, finally, the vast majority of the monks themselves were ignorant,
self-indulgent, profligate, worthless, dissolute.</p>

<p>These, in addition to the heavier accusations, were the charges which the
popular voice had for more than a century brought against the monasteries,
which had led Wycliffe to denounce their existence as intolerable, the
House of Commons to petition Henry IV. for the secularization of their
<span class="sidenote">A hundred houses suppressed by Henry V.</span>
property, and Henry V. to appease the outcry, by the suppression of more
than a hundred, as an ineffectual warning to the
rest.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
At length, in
the year 1489, at the instigation of Cardinal Morton, then Archbishop of
Canterbury, a commission was issued by Innocent VIII. for a general
investigation throughout England into the behaviour of the regular clergy.
The pope said that he had heard, from persons worthy of credit, that abbots
and monks in many places were systematically faithless to their vows; he
<span class="sidenote">Visitation of 1489.</span>
conferred on the archbishop a special power of visitation, and directed him
to admonish, to correct, to punish,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
as might seem to him to be
desirable.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
On the receipt of these instructions, Morton addressed the
following letter to the superior of an abbey within a few miles of
London,&mdash;a peer of the realm, living in the full glare of notoriety,&mdash;a
person whose offences, such as they were, had been committed openly,
palpably, and conspicuously in the face of the world:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archbishop Morton visits the Abbey of St. Alban's.</div>

<p>"John, by Divine permission, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all
England, Legate of the Apostolic See, to William, Abbot of the Monastery of
St. Alban's, greeting.</p>

<p>"We have received certain letters under lead, the copies whereof we
herewith send you, from our most holy Lord and Father in Christ, Innocent,
by Divine Providence Pope, the eighth of that name. We therefore, John, the
archbishop, the visitor, reformer, inquisitor, and judge therein mentioned,
in reverence for the Apostolic See, have taken upon ourselves the burden of
enforcing the said commission; and have determined that we will proceed by,
and according to, the full force, tenour, and effect of the same.</p>

<p>"And it has come to our ears, being at once publicly notorious and brought
before us upon the testimony of many witnesses worthy of credit, that you,
the abbot aforementioned, have been of long time noted and diffamed, and do
yet continue so noted, of Simony, of usury, of dilapidation and waste of
the goods, revenues, and possessions of the said monastery, and of certain
other enormous crimes and excesses hereafter written. In the rule, custody,
and administration of the goods, spiritual and temporal, of the said
monastery, you are so remiss, so negligent, so prodigal, that whereas the
said monastery was of old times founded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> and endowed by the pious devotion
of illustrious princes of famous memory, heretofore kings of this land, the
most noble progenitors of our most serene Lord and King that now is, in
order that true religion might flourish there, that the name of the Most
High, in whose honour and glory it was instituted, might be duly celebrated
there;</p>

<p>"And whereas, in days heretofore the regular observance of the said rule
was greatly regarded, and hospitality was diligently kept;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delinquencies of the abbot and the monks.</div>

<p>"Nevertheless, for no little time, during which you have presided in the
same monastery, you and certain of your fellow monks and brethren (whose
blood, it is feared, through your neglect, a severe Judge will require at
your hand) have relaxed the measure and form of religious life; you have
laid aside the pleasant yoke of contemplation, and all regular observances;
hospitality, alms, and those other offices of piety which of old time were
exercised and ministered therein have decreased, and by your faults, your
carelessness, your neglect and deed, do daily decrease more and more, and
cease to be regarded&mdash;the pious vows of the founders are defrauded of their
just intent; the antient rule of your order is deserted; and not a few of
your fellow monks and brethren, as we most deeply grieve to learn, giving
themselves over to a reprobate mind, laying aside the fear of God, do lead
only a life of lasciviousness&mdash;nay, as is horrible to relate, be not afraid
to defile the holy places, even the very churches of God, by infamous
intercourse with nuns.</p>

<p>"You yourself, moreover, among other grave enormities and abominable crimes
whereof you are guilty, and for which you are noted and diffamed, have, in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> first place, admitted a certain married woman, named Elena Germyn, who
has separated herself without just cause from her husband, and for some
time past has lived in adultery with another man, to be a nun or sister in
the house or Priory of Bray, lying, as you pretend, within your
jurisdiction. You have next appointed the same woman to be prioress of the
said house, notwithstanding that her said husband was living at the time,
and is still alive. And finally, Father Thomas Sudbury, one of your brother
monks, publicly, notoriously, and without interference or punishment from
you, has associated, and still associates, with this woman as an adulterer
with his harlot.</p>

<p>"Moreover, divers other of your brethren and fellow monks have resorted,
and do resort, continually to her and other women at the same place, as to
a public brothel or receiving house, and have revived no correction
therefor.</p>

<p>"Nor is Bray the only house into which you have introduced disorder. At the
nunnery of Sapwell, which you also contend to be under your jurisdiction,
you change the prioresses and superiors again and again at your own will
and caprice. Here, as well as at Bray, you depose those who are good and
religious; you promote to the highest dignities the worthless and the
vicious. The duties of the order are cast aside; virtue is neglected; and
by these means so much cost and extravagance has been caused, that to
provide means for your indulgence you have introduced certain of your
brethren to preside in their houses under the name of guardians, when in
fact they are no guardians, but thieves and notorious villains; and with
their help you have caused and permitted the goods of the same priories to
be dispensed, or to speak more truly to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> dissipated, in the
above-described corruptions and other enormous and accursed offences. Those
places once religious are rendered and reputed as it were profane and
impious; and by your own and your creatures' conduct are so impoverished as
to be reduced to the verge of ruin.</p>

<p>"In like manner, also, you have dealt with certain other cells of monks,
which you say are subject to you, even within the monastery of the glorious
proto-martyr, Alban himself. You have dilapidated the common property; you
have made away with the jewels; the copses, the woods, the underwood,
almost all the oaks and other forest trees, to the value of eight thousand
marks and more, you have made to be cut down without distinction, and they
have by you been sold and alienated. The brethren of the abbey, some of
whom, as is reported, are given over to all the evil things of the world,
neglect the service of God altogether. They live with harlots and
mistresses publicly and continuously, within the precincts of the monastery
and without. Some of them, who are covetous of honour and promotion, and
desirous therefore of pleasing your cupidity, have stolen and made away
with the chalices and other jewels of the church. They have even
sacrilegiously extracted the precious stones from the very shrine of St.
Alban; and you have not punished these men, but have rather knowingly
supported and maintained them. If any of your brethren be living justly and
religiously, if any be wise and virtuous, these you straightway depress and
hold in hatred.... You...."</p>

<p>But this overwhelming document need not be transcribed further. It pursues
its way through mire and filth to its most lame and impotent conclusion.
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> abbot was not deposed; he was invited merely to reconsider his
conduct, and, if possible, amend it.</p>

<p>Offences similar in kind and scarcely less gross were exposed at Waltham,
at St. Andrew's, Northampton, at Calais, and at other places.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Again, a
reprimand was considered to be an adequate punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitation of archbishop Warham in 1511.</div>

<p>Evils so deep and so abominable would not yield to languid treatment; the
visitation had been feeble in its execution and limited in extent. In 1511
a second was attempted by Archbishop Warham.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> This inquiry was more
partial than the first, yet similar practices were brought to light: women
introduced to religious houses; nuns and abbesses accusing one another of
incontinency; the alms collected in the chapels squandered by the monks in
licentiousness. Once more, no cure was attempted beyond a paternal
admonition.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> A third effort was made by Wolsey twelve years later:
again exposure followed, and again no remedy was found.</p>

<p>If the condition of the abbeys had appeared intolerable before
investigation, still less could it be endured when the justice of the
accusations against them had been ascertained. But the church was unequal
to the work of self-reformation. Parliament alone could decide on the
measures which the emergency made necessary; and preparatory to
legislation, the true circumstances and present character of the religious
bodies throughout the whole country were to be ascertained accurately and
completely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Issue of a commission for a general visitation.</div>

<p>Accordingly, in the summer of 1535, directly after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> Sir Thomas More's
execution, Cromwell, now "vicegerent of the king in all his ecclesiastical
jurisdiction within the realm,"<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> issued a commission for a general
visitation of the religious houses, the universities, and other spiritual
corporations. The persons appointed to conduct the inquiry were Doctors
<span class="sidenote">Character of the commissioners.</span>
Legh, Leyton, and Ap Rice, ecclesiastical lawyers in holy orders, with
various subordinates. Legh and Leyton, the two principal commissioners,
were young, impetuous men, likely to execute their work rather thoroughly
than delicately; but, to judge by the surviving evidence, they were as
upright and plain-dealing as they were assuredly able and efficient. It is
pretended by some writers that the inquiry was set on foot with a
preconceived purpose of spoliation; that the duty of the visitors was
rather to defame roundly than to report truly; and that the object of the
commission was merely to justify an act of appropriation which had been
already determined. The commission of Pope Innocent, with the previous
inquiries, puts to silence so gratuitous a supposition; while it is certain
that antecedent to the presentation of the report, an extensive measure of
suppression was not so much as contemplated. The directions to the
<span class="sidenote">First intention of the crown to reform and not to
destroy.</span>
visitors,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> the injunctions they were to carry with them to the various
houses, the private letters to the superiors, which were written by the
king and by Cromwell,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> show plainly that the first object was to reform
and not to destroy; and it was only when reformation was found to be
conclusively hopeless, that the harder alternative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
was resolved upon. The
report itself is no longer extant. Bonner was directed by Queen Mary to
destroy all discoverable copies of it, and his work was fatally well
executed. We are able, however, to replace its contents to some extent, out
of the despatches of the commissioners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The commissioners issue an inhibition against the bishops.</div>

<p>Their discretionary powers were unusually large, as appears from the first
act with which the visitors commenced operations. On their own
responsibility, they issued an inhibition against the bishops, forbidding
them to exercise any portion of their jurisdiction while the visitation was
in progress. The sees themselves were to be inspected; and they desired to
make the ground clear before they moved. When the amazed bishops exclaimed
against so unheard-of an innovation, Doctor Legh justified the order by
saying, that it was well to compel the prelates to know and feel their new
position; and in the fact of their suspension by a royal commission, to
"agnize" the king as the source of episcopal authority.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And commence work at Oxford, Sept. 12.</div>

<p>Truly it was an altered world since the bishops sent in their answer to the
complaints of the House of Commons. The visitors, in this haughty style,
having established their powers, began work with the university of Oxford.
Their time was short, for parliament was to meet early in the spring, when
their report was to be submitted to it; and their business meanwhile was
not only to observe and inquire, but any reforms which were plainly useful
and good, they were themselves to execute. They had no time for hesitation,
therefore;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
and they laid their hands to the task before them with a
promptitude at which we can only wonder. The heads of houses, as may be
<span class="sidenote">Condition of the University.<br /><br />
Efforts of the heads of houses.</span>
supposed, saw little around them which was in need of reform. A few
students of high genius and high purposes had been introduced into the
university, as we have seen, by Wolsey; and these had been assiduously
exiled or imprisoned. All suspected books had been hunted out. There had
been fagot processions in High-street, and bonfires of New Testaments at
Carfax. The daily chapels, we suppose, had gone forward as usual, and the
drowsy lectures on the Schoolmen; while "towardly young men" who were
venturing stealthily into the perilous heresy of Greek, were eyed askance
by the authorities, and taught to tremble at their temerity. All this we
might have looked for; and among the authorities themselves, also, the
<span class="sidenote">Parish clergy idling at the colleges under pretence of
study.</span>
world went forward in a very natural manner. There was comfortable living
in the colleges: so comfortable, that many of the country clergy preferred
Oxford and Cambridge to the monotony of their parishes, and took advantage
of a clause in a late act of parliament, which recognised a residence at
either of the universities as an excuse for absence from tedious duties.
"Divers and many persons," it was found, "beneficed with cure of souls, and
being not apt to study by reason of their age or otherwise, ne never
intending before the making of the said act to travel in study, but rather
minding their own ease and pleasure, colourably to defraud the same good
statute, did daily and commonly resort to the said universities, where,
under pretence of study, they continued and abode, living dissolutely;
nothing profiting themselves in learning, but consumed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> the time in
idleness and pastimes and insolent pleasures, giving occasion and evil
example thereby to the young men and students within the universities, and
occupying such rooms and commodities as were instituted for the maintenance
and relief of poor
scholars."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
These persons were not driven away by
the heads of houses as the Christian Brothers had been; they were welcomed
rather as pleasant companions. In comfortable conservatism they had no
tendencies to heresy, but only to a reasonable indulgence of their five
bodily senses. Doubtless, therefore, the visitors found Oxford a pleasant
<span class="sidenote">The disturbers of order and quiet.<br /><br />
Revolution of studies.</span>
place, and cruelly they marred the enjoyments of it. Like a sudden storm of
rain, they dropt down into its quiet precincts. Heedless of rights of
fellows and founders' bequests, of sleepy dignities and established
indolences, they re-established long dormant lectures in the colleges. In a
few little days (for so long only they remained) they poured new life into
education. They founded fresh professorships&mdash;professorships of Polite
Latin, professorships of Philosophy, Divinity, Canon Law, Natural
Sciences&mdash;above all of the dreaded Greek; confiscating funds to support
them. For the old threadbare text-books, some real teaching was swiftly
substituted. The idle residents were noted down, soon to be sent home by
parliament to their benefices, under pain of being compelled, like all
other students, to attend lectures, and, in their proper persons, "keep
sophisms, problems, disputations, and all other exercises of
learning."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />Revolution of discipline.</div>

<p>The discipline was not neglected: "we have enjoined the religious
students,"<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
Leyton wrote to Cromwell,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
"that none of them, for no
manner of cause, shall come within any tavern, inn, or alehouse, or any
other house, whatsoever it be, within the town and suburbs. [Each offender]
once so taken, to be sent home to his cloyster. Without doubt, this act is
greatly lamented of all honest women of the town; and especially of their
laundresses, that may not now once enter within the gates, much less within
the chambers, whereunto they were right well accustomed. I doubt not, but
for this thing, only the honest matrons will sue to you for
redress."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
These were sharp measures; we lose our breath at their rapidity and
violence. The saddest vicissitude was that which befell the famous
<span class="sidenote">Memorable fate of Duns Scotus.</span>
Duns&mdash;Duns Scotus, the greatest of the Schoolmen, the constructor of the
<i>memoria technica</i> of ignorance, the ancient text-book of <i>&agrave; priori</i>
knowledge, established for centuries the supreme despot in the Oxford
lecture-rooms. "We have set Duns in Bocardo," says Leyton. He was thrown
down from his high estate, and from being lord of the Oxford intellect, was
"made the common servant of all men;" condemned by official sentence to the
lowest degradation to which book can be submitted.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Some copies escaped
this worst fate; but for changed uses thenceforward. The second occasion on
which the visitors came to New College, they "found the great Quadrant
Court full of the leaves of Duns, the wind blowing them into every corner;
and one Mr. Greenfield, a gentleman of Buckinghamshire, gathering up part
of the same book leaves, as he said, to make him sewers or blawnsheres, to
keep the deer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> within his wood, thereby to have the better cry with his
hounds."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>To such base uses all things return at last; dust unto dust, when the life
has died out of them, and the living world needs their companionship no
longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br/><br />Progress of the visitors.<br /><br /><br />
Uniformity of result.<br /><br /><br />
The <i>animus improbus</i>.</div>

<p>On leaving Oxford, the visitors spread over England, north, south, east,
and west. We trace Legh in rapid progress through Bedfordshire,
Cambridgeshire, Lincoln, Yorkshire, and Northumberland; Leyton through
Middlesex, Kent, Sussex, Hants, Somersetshire, and Devon. They appeared at
monastery after monastery, with prompt, decisive questions; and if the
truth was concealed, with expedients for discovering it, in which practice
soon made them skilful. All but everywhere the result was the same. At
intervals a light breaks through, and symptoms appear of some efforts after
decency; but in the vast majority of the smaller houses, the previous
results were repeated, the popular suspicions were more than confirmed.
Wolsey, when writing to the pope of his intended reformation, had spoken of
the <i>animus improbus</i>, and the frightful symptoms which existed of it. He
was accused, in his attempted impeachment, of having defamed the character
of the English clergy. Yet Wolsey had written no more than the truth, as
was too plainly discovered. I do not know what to say on this matter, or
what to leave unsaid. If I am to relate the suppression of the monasteries,
I should relate also why they were suppressed. If I were to tell the truth,
I should have first to warn all modest eyes to close the book, and read no
further. It will perhaps be sufficient if I introduce a few superficial
stories, suggestive rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> illustrative of the dark matter which
remains in the shade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sion Monastery.</div>

<p>I have spoken more than once of the monastery of Sion. It was the scene of
the Nun of Kent's intrigues. It furnished more than one martyr for the
Catholic cause; and the order was Carthusian&mdash;one of the strictest in
England. There were two houses attached to the same establishment&mdash;one of
monks, another of nuns. The confessors of the women were chosen from the
friars, and they were found to have abused their opportunities in the most
infamous manner. With a hateful mixture of sensuality and superstition, the
<span class="sidenote">The confessional, and the fruits of it.</span>
offence and the absolution went hand-in-hand. One of these confessors, so
zealous for the pope that he professed himself ready to die for the Roman
cause, was in the habit of using language so filthy to his penitents, that
it was necessary to "sequester him from hearing ladies' confessions." The
nuns petitioned the visitors, on the exposure of the seduction of a sister,
that he and his companion might come to them no more; and the friar was
told that his abominable conduct might be the occasion that "shrift should
be laid down in England."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>This is one instance of an evil found fatally prevalent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forged licenses for profligacy.</div>

<p>Again, the clergy were suspected of obtaining dispensations from their
superiors indulging in a breach of their vows. The laxity of the church
courts in dealing with clerical delinquents had perhaps given rise to this
belief; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> accusation was confirmed by a discovery at Maiden Bradley,
in Wiltshire. The prior of this house had a family of illegitimate
children, whom he brought up and provided for in a very comfortable
manner;<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and the visitor wrote that "<i>the pope, considering his
fragility</i>," had granted him a licence in this little matter; that he had,
in fact, "a good writing <i>sub plumbo</i>, to discharge his conscience." I do
not easily believe that <i>authentic</i> dispensations of such a kind were
obtained from Rome, or were obtainable from it; but of forged
dispensations, invented by reverend offenders or fraudulently issued by the
local ecclesiastical authorities, to keep appearances smooth, there were
probably enough, and too many.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to Langden Abbey, Oct. 22.</div>

<p>The more ordinary experiences of the commissioners may be described by
Leyton himself, in an account which he wrote of his visit to Langden Abbey,
near Dover. The style is graphic, and the picture of the scene one of the
most complete which remains. The letter is to Cromwell.</p>

<p>"Please it your goodness to understand that on Friday, the 22nd of October,
I rode back with speed to take an inventory of Folkstone, and from thence I
went to Langden. Whereat immediately descending from my horse, I sent
Bartlett, your servant, with all my servants, to circumspect the abbey, and
surely to keep all back-doors and starting-holes. I myself went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> alone to
the abbot's lodging, joining upon the fields and wood, even like a cony
clapper, full of starting-holes. [I was] a good space knocking at the
abbot's door; <i>nec vox nec sensus apparuit</i>, saving the abbot's little dog
that within his door fast locked bayed and barked. I found a short poleaxe
standing behind the door, and with it I dashed the abbot's door in pieces,
<i>ictu oculi</i>, and set one of my men to keep that door; and about the house
I go, with that poleaxe in my hand, <i>ne forte</i>, for the abbot is a
dangerous desperate knave, and a hardy. But for a conclusion, his
gentlewoman bestirred her stumps towards her starting-holes; and then
Bartlett, watching the pursuit, took the tender damoisel; and, after I had
examined her, [brought her] to Dover to the mayor, to set her in some cage
or prison for eight days; and I brought holy father abbot to Canterbury,
and here in Christchurch I will leave him in prison. In this sudden doing

too long. Now it shall appear to gentlemen of this country, and other the

<div class="sidenote">October. Nunnery of Lichfield.</div>

<p>Towards the close of the year, Leyton went north to join Legh; and together
they visited a nunnery at Lichfield. The religious orders were bound by
oaths similar to those which have recently created difficulty in Oxford.
They were sworn to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
divulge nothing which might prejudice the interests of
the houses. The superior at Lichfield availed herself of this plea. When
questioned as to the state of the convent, she and the sisterhood refused
to allow that there was any disorder, or any irregularity, which could give
occasion for inquiry. Her assertions were not implicitly credited; the
inspection proceeded, and at length two of the sisters were discovered to
<span class="sidenote">Two of the sisterhood found "not barren."</span>
be "not barren"; a priest in one instance having been the occasion of the
misfortune, and a serving-man in the other. No confession could be obtained
either from the offenders themselves, or from the society. The secret was
betrayed by an "old beldame"; "and when," says Leyton, "I objected against
the prioresses, that if they could not show me a cause reasonable of their
concealment, I must needs, and would, punish them for their manifest
perjury,&mdash;their answer was, that they were bound by their religion never to
confess the secret faults done amongst them, but only to a visitor of their
own religion, and to that they were sworn, every one of them, on their
first admission."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abbey of Fountains.</div>

<p>A little later the commissioners were at Fountains Abbey; and tourists, who
in their daydreams among those fair ruins are inclined to complain of the
sacrilege which wasted the houses of prayer, may study with advantage the
following account of that house in the year which preceded its dissolution.
The outward beautiful ruin was but the symbol and consequence of a moral
ruin not so beautiful. "The Abbot of Fountains," we read in a joint letter
of Legh and Leyton, had "greatly dilapidated his house, [and] wasted the
woods, notoriously keeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
six women. [He is] defamed here," they say, "<i>a
toto populo</i>, one day denying these articles, with many more, the next day
<span class="sidenote">Theft and sacrilege committed by the abbot.</span>
confessing the same, thus manifestly incurring perjury." Six days before
the visitors' access to his monastery "he committed theft and sacrilege,
confessing the same. At midnight he caused his chaplain to seize the
sexton's keys, and took out a jewel, a cross of gold with stones. One
Warren, a goldsmith in the Chepe, was with him in his chamber at that hour,
and there they stole out a great emerald, with a ruby. The said Warren made
the abbot believe the ruby to be but a garnet, so that for this he paid
nothing. For the emerald he paid but twenty pounds. He sold him also the
plate without weight or ounces; how much the abbot was deceived therein he
cannot tell, for he is a very fool and miserable idiot."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The visitors instructed to make inventories of the property, and
to bring away the superfluous plate.<br /><br />
False returns made by the abbots.</div>

<p>Under an impression that frauds of this description were becoming frequent,
the government had instructed the commissioners to take inventories of the
plate and jewels; and where they saw occasion for suspicion, to bring away
whatever seemed superfluous, after leaving a supply sufficient for the
services of the house and chapel. The misdemeanour of the Abbot of
Fountains was not the only justification of these directions. Sometimes the
plate was secreted. The Prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, was accused of
having sent in a false return,<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> keeping back gold and precious stones
valued at a thousand pounds. Information was given by some of the
breth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>ren, who professed to fear that the prior would poison them in
revenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scene at Norton Abbey in Cheshire.</div>

<p>Occasionally the monks ventured on rougher methods to defend themselves.
Here is a small spark of English life while the investigation was in
progress, lighted by a stray letter from an English gentleman of Cheshire.
The lord chancellor was informed by Sir Piers Dutton, justice of the peace,
that the visitors had been at Norton Abbey. They had concluded their
inspection, had packed up such jewels and plate as they purposed to remove,
and were going away; when, the day being late and the weather foul, they
changed their minds, and resolved to spend the night where they were. In
the evening, "the abbot," says Sir Piers, "gathered together a great
company, to the number of two or three hundred persons, so that the
commissioners were in fear of their lives, and were fain to take a tower
there; and therefrom sent a letter unto me, ascertaining me what danger
they were in, and desiring me to come and assist them, or they were never
likely to come thence. Which letter came to me about nine of the clock, and
about two o'clock on the same night I came thither with such of my tenants
as I had near about me, and found divers fires made, as well within the
gates as without; and the said abbot had caused an ox to be killed, with
other victuals, and prepared for such of his company as he had there. I
used some policy, and came suddenly upon them. Some of them took to the
pools and water, and it was so dark that I could not find them. Howbeit I
took the abbot and three of his canons, and brought them to the king's
castle of Hatton."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
If, however, the appropriation of the jewels led to occasional resistance,
another duty which the commissioners were to discharge secured them as
often a warm and eager welcome. It was believed that the monastic
institutions had furnished an opportunity, in many quarters, for the
disposal of inconvenient members of families. Children of both sexes, it
was thought, had been forced into abbeys and convents at an age too young
<span class="sidenote">Monks under 24, and nuns under 21, set free from
their vows.</span>
to have allowed them a free choice in the sacrifice of their lives. To all
such, therefore, the doors of their prison house were thrown open. On the
day of visitation, when the brethren, or the sisterhood, were assembled,
the visitors informed everywhere such monks as were under twenty-four, and
such nuns as were under twenty-one, that they might go where they pleased.
To those among them who preferred to return to the world, a secular dress
was given, and forty shillings in money, and they were restored to the full
privileges of the laity.</p>

<p>The opportunity so justly offered was passionately embraced. It was
attended only with this misfortune, that the line was arbitrarily drawn,
and many poor wretches who found themselves condemned by the accident of a
few more days or months of life to perpetual imprisonment, made piteous
<span class="sidenote">The monks at Fordham petition for release.</span>
entreaties for an extension of the terms of freedom. At Fordham, in
Cambridgeshire, Dr. Legh wrote to Cromwell, "the religious persons kneeling
on their knees, instantly with humble petition desire of God and the king
and you, to be dismissed from their religion, saying they live in it
contrary to God's law and their consciences; trusting that the king, of his
gracious goodness, and you, will set them at liberty out of their bondage,
which they are not able to endure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
but should fall into desperation, or
else run away." "It were a deed of charity," he continued, fresh from the
scene where he had witnessed the full misery of their condition, "that they
might live in that kind of living which might be most to the glory of God,
the quietness of their consciences, and most to the commonwealth,
<i>whosoever hath informed you to the
contrary</i>."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
Similar expressions of
sympathy are frequent in the visitors' letters. Sometimes the poor monks
sued directly to the vicar-general, and Cromwell must have received many
petitions as strange, as helpless, and as graphic, as this which follows.
The writer was a certain Brother Beerley, a Benedictine monk of Pershore,
in Worcestershire. It is amusing to find him addressing the vicar-general
as his "most reverend lord in God." I preserve the spelling, which,
however, will with some difficulty be found intelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of a monk of Pershore to Cromwell.</div>

<p>In reply to these and similar evidences of the state of the monasteries, it
will be easy to say, that in the best ages there were monks impatient of
their vows, and abbots negligent of their duties; that human weakness and
human wickedness may throw a stain over the noblest institutions; that
nothing is proved by collecting instances which may be merely exceptions,
and that no evidence is more fallacious than that which rests upon isolated
facts.</p>

<p>It is true; and the difficulty is felt as keenly by the accuser who brings
forward charges which it is discreditable to have urged, if they cannot be
substantiated, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> by those who would avail themselves of the easy opening
to evade the weight of the indictment. I have to say only, that if the
extracts which I have made lead persons disposed to differ with me to
examine the documents which are extant upon the subject, they will learn
what I have concealed as well as what I have alleged; and I believe that,
if they begin the inquiry (as I began it myself) with believing that the
religious orders had been over-hardly judged, they will close it with but
one desire&mdash;that the subject shall never more be mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New regulations enforced by the commissioners.</div>

<p>Leaving, then, the moral condition in which the visitors found these
houses, we will now turn to the regulations which they were directed to
enforce for the future. When the investigation at each of the houses had
been completed, when the young monks and nuns had been dismissed, the
accounts audited, the property examined, and the necessary inquiries had
been made into the manners and habits of the establishment, the remaining
fraternity were then assembled in the chapter-house, and the commissioners
delivered to them their closing directions. No differences were made
between the orders. The same language was used everywhere. The statute of
supremacy was first touched upon; and the injunction was repeated for the
detailed observance of it. Certain broad rules of moral obedience were then
laid down, to which all "religious" men without exception were expected to
submit.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The monks confined within walls.</div>

<p>No monks, thenceforward, were to leave the precincts of the monastery to
which they belonged, under any pretext; they were to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>fine themselves
within the walls, to the house, the gardens, and the grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No women to be admitted within the precincts.<br /><br />
The brethren to dine together in hall, gravely and decently.</div>

<p>No women were to come within the walls, without licence from the king or
the visitor; and, to prevent all unpermitted ingress or egress, private
doors and posterns were to be walled up. There was, in future, to be but
one entrance only, by the great foregate; and this was to be diligently
watched by a porter. The "brethren" were to take their meals decently in
the common hall. They were not to clamour, as they had been in the habit of
doing, "for any certain, usual, or accustomed portion of meat;" but were to
be content with what was set before them, giving thanks to God.</p>

<p>To ensure gravity and decency, one of the brethren, at every refection, was
to read aloud a chapter of the Old or New Testament.</p>

<p>The abbot was "to keep an honest and hospitable table;" and an almoner was
to be appointed in each house, to collect the broken meats, and to
distribute them among the deserving poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Valiant, mighty, and idle beggars no longer to be supported.</div>

<p>Special care was to be taken in this last article, and "<i>by no means should
such alms be given to valiant, mighty, and idle beggars and vagabonds, such
as commonly use to resort to such places; which rather as drove beasts and
mychers should be driven away and compelled to labour, than in their
idleness and lewdness be cherished and maintained, to the great hindrance
and damage of the commonweal</i>."</p>

<p>All other alms and distributions, either prescribed by the statutes of the
foundations, or established by the customs of the abbeys, were to be made
and given as largely as at any past time.</p>

<p>The abbots were to make no waste of the woods or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> lands. They were to keep
their accounts with an annual audit, faithfully and truly.</p>

<p>No fairs nor markets were any more to be held within the precincts.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Every monk was to have a separate bed, and not to have any child or boy
lying with him, or otherwise haunting unto him.</p>

<p>The "brethren" were to occupy themselves in daily reading or other honest
and laudable exercises. Especially there was to be every day one general
lesson in Holy Scripture, at which every member of the house was bound to
be present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Some portion of the rule which the monks have professed shall
every day be read to them.</div>

<p>Finally, that they might all understand the meaning of their position in
the world, and the intention, which they had so miserably forgotten, of the
foundations to which they belonged, the abbot, prior, or president, was
every day to explain in English some of the portion of the rule which they
had professed; "applying the same always to the doctrine of Christ." The
language of the injunctions is either Cromwell's or the king's; and the
passage upon this subject is exceedingly beautiful.</p>

<p>"The abbot shall teach them that the said rule, and other their principles
of religion (so far as they be laudable), be taken out of Holy Scripture:
and he shall shew them the places from whence they be derived: and that
their ceremonies and other observances be none other things than as the
first letters or principles, and certain introductions to true
Christianity: and that true religion is not contained in apparel, manner of
going, shaven heads, and such other marks; nor in silence, fasting,
uprising in the night, singing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> and such other kind of ceremonies; but in
cleanness of mind, pureness of living, Christ's faith not feigned, and
brotherly charity, and true honouring of God in spirit and verity: and that
those abovesaid things were instituted and begun, that they being first
exercised in these, in process of time might ascend to those as by certain
steps&mdash;that is to say, to the chief point and end of religion. And
therefore, let them be exhorted that they do not continually stick and
surcease in such ceremonies and observances, as though they had perfectly
fulfilled the chief and outmost of the whole of true religion; but that
when they have once passed such things, they should endeavour themselves
after higher things, and convert their minds from such external matters to
more inward and deeper considerations, as the law of God and Christian
religion doth teach and shew: and that they assure not themselves of any
reward or commodity by reason of such ceremonies and observances, except
they refer all such to Christ, and for his sake observe them."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Certainly, no government which intended to make the irregularities of an
institution an excuse for destroying it, ever laboured more assiduously to
defeat its own objects. Those who most warmly disapprove of the treatment
of the monasteries have so far no reason to complain; and except in the one
point of the papal supremacy, under which, be it remembered, the religious
orders had luxuriated in corruption, Becket or Hildebrand would scarcely
have done less or more than what had as yet been attempted by Henry.</p>

<p>But the time had now arrived when the results of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
the investigation were to
be submitted to the nation. The parliament&mdash;the same old parliament of
1529, which had commenced the struggle with the bishops&mdash;was now meeting
for its last session, to deal with this its greatest and concluding
<span class="sidenote">1536. Parliament meets for its last session.<br /><br />
February. Preliminary measures.</span>
difficulty. It assembled on the 4th of February, and the preliminaries of
the great question being not yet completed, the Houses were first occupied
with simplifying justice and abolishing the obsolete privileges of the
Northern palatinates.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
Other minor matters were also disposed of.
Certain questionable people, who were taking advantage of the confusion of
the times to "withhold tythes," were animadverted
upon.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The treason
law was further extended to comprehend the forging of the king's
sign-manual, signet, and privy seal, "divers light and evil-disposed
persons having of late had the courage to commit such offences." The scale
of fees at the courts of law was fixed by
statute;<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> and felons having
protection of sanctuary were no longer to be permitted to leave the
precincts, and return at their pleasure. When they went abroad, they were
<span class="sidenote">The commissioners present their report.</span>
to wear badges, declaring who and what they were; and they were to be
within bounds after sunset. In these and similar regulations the early
weeks of the session were consumed. At length the visitors had finished
their work, and the famous <i>Black Book</i> of the monasteries was laid on the
table of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>This book, I have said, unhappily no longer exists. Persons however who
read it have left on record emphatic descriptions of its contents; and the
preamble of the act of parliament of which it formed the foundation, dwells
upon its character with much distinctness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> I cannot discuss the insoluble
question whether the stories which it contained were true. History is ill
occupied with discussing probabilities on <i>&agrave; priori</i> grounds, when the
scale of likelihood is graduated by antecedent prejudice. It is enough that
the report was drawn up by men who had the means of knowing the truth, and
who were apparently under no temptation to misrepresent what they had seen;
that the description coincides with the authentic letters of the visitors;
and that the account was generally accepted as true by the English
parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two thirds of the monks are living in habits which may not be
described.</div>

<p>It appeared, then, on this authority, that two-thirds of the monks in
England were living in habits which may not be described. The facts were
related in great detail. The confessions of parties implicated were
produced, signed by their own hands.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The vows were not observed. The
lands were wasted, sold, and mortgaged. The foundations were incomplete.
The houses were falling to waste; within and without, the monastic system
was in ruins. In the smaller abbeys especially, where, from the limitation
of numbers, the members were able to connive securely at each other's
misdemeanours, they were saturated with profligacy, with Simony, with
drunkenness.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
The case against the monasteries was complete; and there
is no occasion either to be surprised or peculiarly horrified at the
discovery. The demoralization which was exposed was nothing less and
nothing more than the condition into which men of average nature compelled
to celibacy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> and living as the exponents of a system which they
disbelieved, were certain to fall.</p>

<p>There were exceptions. In the great monasteries, or in many of them, there
was decency and honourable management; but when all the establishments,
large and small, had been examined, a third only could claim to be exempted
from the darkest schedule. This was the burden of the report which was
submitted to the legislature. So long as the extent of the evil was
unknown, it could be tolerated; when it had been exposed to the world,
honour and justice alike required a stronger remedy than an archiepiscopal
<span class="sidenote">A great debate in the House.</span>
remonstrance. A "great debate" followed.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The journals of the session
are lost, and we cannot replace the various arguments; but there was not a
member of either House who was not connected, either by personal interest,
or by sacred associations, with one or other of the religious houses; there
was not one whose own experience could not test in some degree the accuracy
of the <i>Black Book</i>; and there was no disposition to trifle with
institutions which were the cherished dependencies of the great English
families.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March. Difficulty of arriving at a resolution.</div>

<p>The instincts of conservatism, association, sympathy, respect for ancient
bequests, and a sense of the sacredness of property set apart for holy
uses, and guarded by anathemas, all must have been against a dissolution;
yet, so far as we can supply the loss of the journals from other accounts
of the feeling of the time, there seems to have been neither hope nor
desire of preserving the old system&mdash;of preserving the houses, that is,
collectively under their existing statutes as foundations in themselves
inviolate. The visitation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
had been commenced with a hope that extremities
might still be avoided. But all expectation of this kind vanished before
the fatal evidence which had been produced. The House of Commons had for a
century and a half been familiar with the thought of suppression as a
possible necessity. The time was come when, if not suppression, yet some
analogous measure had become imperative. The smaller establishments, at
least, could not and might not continue. Yet while, so far, there was
<span class="sidenote">Conflicting interests. The representatives of the founders.<br /><br />
Divided opinion of the Reformers.</span>
general agreement, it was no easy matter to resolve upon a satisfactory
remedy. The representatives of the founders considered that, if houses were
suppressed which had been established out of estates which had belonged to
their forefathers, those estates should revert to the heirs, or at least,
that the heirs should recover them upon moderate
terms.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
In the
Reforming party there was difference of opinion on the legality of
secularizing property which had been given to God. Latimer, and partially
Cromwell, inherited the designs of Wolsey; instead of taking away from the
church the lands of the abbeys, they were desirous of seeing those lands
transferred to the high and true interests of religion. They wished to
convert the houses into places of education, and to reform, wherever
possible, the ecclesiastical bodies
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>

it has been since the dream of many other good men who have not rightly

stains, and came out fresh robed in the wedding-garment of purity, should
have been chosen to strip it of its resources, and depose it from power and
pre&euml;minence. Cranmer, on the other hand, less imaginative but more
practical, was reluctant that clerical corporations should be continued
under any pretext&mdash;even under the mild form of cathedral chapters. Cranmer
desired to see the secular system of the church made as efficient as
possible; the religious system, in its technical sense, he believed to have
become a nursery of idleness, and believed that no measures of reform could
restore the old tone to institutions which the world had
<span class="sidenote">Cranmer more right than Latimer, as experience has
proved.</span>
outgrown.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
In the present age it will perhaps be considered that Cranmer's sagacity was
more right than Latimer's enthusiasm, however at the moment men's warmer
instincts might seem to have pleaded for the latter. The subsequent history
both of the Scotch and English church permits the belief that neither would
have been benefited by the possession of larger wealth than was left to
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
A purer doctrine has not corrected those careless and questionable
habits in the management of property which were exposed by the visitors of
1535. Whether the cause of the phenomenon lies in an indifference to the
things of the world, or in the more dubious palliation that successive
incumbents have only a life-interest in their incomes, the experience of
<span class="sidenote">The instincts of the laity guide them truly.</span>
three centuries has proved the singular unfitness of spiritual persons for
the administration of secular trusts; and the friends of the establishment
may be grateful that the judgment of the English laity ultimately guided
them to this conclusion. They were influenced, it is likely, by a principle
which they showed rather in their deeds than in their words. They would not
recognise any longer the distinction on which the claims of the abbeys were
rested. Property given to God, it was urged, might not be again taken from
God, but must remain for ever in his service. It was replied in substance
that God's service was not divided, but one; that all duties honestly done
were religious duties; that the person of the layman was as sacred as the
person of the priest; and the liturgy of obedience as acceptable as the
liturgy of words.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Necessity of caution.</div>

<p>Yet if, in the end, men found their way clearly, they moved towards it with
slow steps; and the first resolution at which they arrived embodied
partially the schemes of each of the honest reformers. In touching
institutions with which the feelings of the nation were deeply connected,
prudence and principle alike dictated caution. However bitterly the people
might exclaim against the abbeys while they continued to stand, their
faults, if they were destroyed, would soon be forgotten. Institutions which
had been rooted in the country for so many centuries, retained a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> hold too
deep to be torn away without wounding a thousand associations; and a
<span class="sidenote">Aversion of English statesmen to sweeping measures.</span>
reaction of regret would inevitably follow among men so conservative as the
English, so possessed with reverence for the old traditions of their
fathers. This was to be considered; or rather the parliament, the crown,
and the council felt as the people felt. Vast as the changes were which had
been effected, there had been as yet no sweeping measures. At each
successive step, Henry had never moved without reluctance. He hated
anarchy; he hated change: in the true spirit of an Englishman, he never
surrendered an institution or a doctrine till every means had been
exhausted of retaining it, consistently with allegiance to truth. The
larger monasteries, therefore, with many of the rest, had yet four years
allowed them to demonstrate the hopelessness of their amendment, the
impossibility of their renovation. The remainder were to reap the
consequences of their iniquities; and the judicial sentence was pronounced
at last in a spirit as rational as ever animated the English legislature.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch," says the preamble of the Act of Dissolution, "as manifest sin,
vicious, carnal, and abominable living, is daily used and committed among
the little and small abbeys, priories, and other religious houses of monks,
canons, and nuns, where the congregation or such religious persons is under
the number of twelve, whereby the governors of such religious houses and
their convents, spoil, consume, destroy, and utterly waste their churches,
monasteries, principal houses, farms, and granges, to the high displeasure

King's Highness and of the realm, if redress should not be

heretofore had by the space of two hundred years and more, for an honest
and charitable reformation of such unthrifty, carnal, and abominable
living; yet nevertheless, little or none amendment is hitherto had, but
their vicious living shamelessly increaseth and augmenteth, and by a cursed
custom is so rooted and infested, that a great multitude of the religious
persons in such small houses do rather choose to rove abroad in apostacy
<span class="sidenote">And forasmuch as reformation is seen to be
hopeless,</span>
than to conform them to the observation of true religion; so that without
such small houses be utterly suppressed, and the religious persons therein
committed to great and honourable monasteries of religion in this realm,
where they may be compelled to live religiously for the reformation of
their lives, there can be no reformation in this behalf: in consideration
hereof the King's most royal Majesty, being supreme head on earth, under
God, of the Church of England, daily finding and devising the increase,
advancement, and exaltation, of true doctrine and virtue in the said
Church, to the only glory of God, and the total extirping and destruction
of vice and sin; having knowledge that the premises be true, as well by
accounts of his late visitation as by sundry credible informations;
considering also that divers great monasteries of this realm, wherein,
<span class="sidenote">It is believed that God will be better pleased to see the
possessions of such houses, now wasted in evil living, applied to better
purpose.</span>
thanks be to God, religion is right well kept and observed, be destitute of
such full number of religious persons as they ought and may keep; hath
thought good that a plain declaration should be made of the premises, as
well to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal as to other his loving subjects

and shall be much more to the pleasure of Almighty God, and for the honour
of this His realm, that the possessions of such spiritual houses, now
spent, and spoiled, and wasted for increase and maintenance of sin, should
be converted to better uses; and the unthrifty religious persons so
spending the same be compelled to reform their lives."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>The parliament went on to declare, that the lands of all monasteries the

All debts, whether of the houses or of the brothers individually, were to
be carefully paid; and finally, one more clause was added, sufficient in
itself to show the temper in which the suppression had been resolved upon.
The visitors had reported a few of the smaller abbeys as free from stain.
The king was empowered, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> his discretion, to permit them to survive; and

<p>This is the history of the first suppression of the monasteries under Henry
VIII. We regret the depravity by which it was occasioned; but the measure
itself, in the absence of any preferable alternative, was bravely and
wisely resolved. In the general imperfection of human things, no measure
affecting the interests of large bodies of men was ever yet devised which
has not pressed unequally, and is not in some respects open to objection.
We can but choose the best among many doubtful courses, when we would be
gladly spared, if we might be spared, from choosing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The laity only see their way clearly.</div>

<p>In this great transaction, it is well to observe that the laity alone saw
their way clearly. The majority of the bishops, writhing under the
inhibitions, looked on in sullen acquiescence, submitting in a forced
conformity, and believing, not without cause, that a tide which flowed so
hotly would before long turn and ebb back again. Among the Reforming clergy
there was neither union nor prudence; and the Protestants, in the sudden
sunshine, were becoming unmanageable and extravagant. On the bench there
were but four prelates who were on the moving side,&mdash;Cranmer, Latimer,
Shaxton, and Barlow,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>&mdash;and among these Cranmer only approved the policy
of the government. Shaxton was an arrogant braggart, and Barlow a feeble
enthusiast. Shaxton, who had flinched from the stake when Bilney was burnt,
Shaxton,

<span class="sidenote">Unwisdom of the Protestant bishops.</span>
who subsequently relapsed under Mary, and became himself a
Romanist persecutor, was now strutting in his new authority, and punishing,
suspending, and inhibiting in behalf of Protestant doctrines which were not
yet tolerated by the law.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Barlow had been openly preaching that
purgatory was a delusion; that a layman might be a bishop; that where two
or three, it might be, "cobblers or weavers," "were in company in the name
of God, there was the church of God."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Such ill-judged precipitancy was
of darker omen to the Reformation than papal excommunications or imperial
menaces, and would soon be dearly paid for in fresh martyr-fires. Latimer,
too, notwithstanding his clear perception and gallant heart, looked with
bitterness on the confiscation of establishments which his mind had
pictured to him as garrisoned with a Reforming army, as nurseries of
apostles of the truth. Like most fiery-natured men, he was ill-pleased to
see the stream flowing in a channel other than that which he had marked for
it; and the state of his feeling, and the state of the English world, with
all its confused imaginings, in these months, is described with some
distinctness in a letter written by a London curate to the Mayor of
Plymouth, on the 13th of March, 1535-36, while the bill for the suppression
of the abbeys was in progress through parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of a London curate to the Mayor of Plymouth.<br /><br />
Vision of the Trinity by Dr. Crewkhorne.</div>

<p>"Right Worshipful,&mdash;On the morrow after that Master Hawkins departed from
hence, I, having nothing to do, as an idler went to Lambeth to the bishop's
palace, to see what news; and I took a wherry at Paul's Wharf, wherein<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
also was already a doctor named Crewkhorne, which was sent for to come to
the Bishop of Canterbury. And he, before the three Bishops of Canterbury,
Worcester, and Salisbury, confessed that he was rapt into heaven, where he
saw the Trinity sitting in a pall or mantle or cope of blew colour; and
from the middle upward they were three bodies, and from the middle downward
were they closed all three into one body. And he spake with Our Lady, and
she took him by the hand, and bade him serve her as he had done in time
past; and bade him preach abroad that she would be honoured at Ipswich and
Willesdon as she hath been in old times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 13.</div>

<p>"On Tuesday in Ember week, the Bishop of Rochester<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> came to Crutched
Friars, and inhibited a doctor and three or four more to near confession;
and so in Cardmaker and other places. Then the Bishop of London's apparitor
came and railed on the other bishops, and said that he, nor no such as he,
shall have jurisdiction within his Lord's precincts. Then was the Bishop of
London sent for to make answer; but he was sick and might not come. On
Friday, the clergy sat on it in Convocation House a long time, and left off
till another day; and in the meantime, all men that have taken loss or
wrong at his hands, must bring in their bills, and shall have recompence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latimer preaches at Paul's Cross, and is disrespectful to

<p>"On Sunday last, the Bishop of Worcester preached at Paul's Cross, and he
said that bishops, abbots, priors, parsons, canons, resident priests, and
all, were strong thieves; yea, dukes, lords, and all. The king, quoth he,
made a marvellous good act of parliament, that certain men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> should sow
every of them two acres of hemp; but it were all too little, even if so
much more, to hang the thieves that be in England. Bishops, abbots, with
such others, should not have so many servants, nor so many dishes; but to
go to their first foundation; and keep hospitality to feed the needy
people&mdash;not jolly fellows, with golden chains and velvet gowns; ne let
these not once come into houses of religion for repast. Let them call knave
bishop, knave abbot, knave prior, yet feed none of them all, nor their
horses, nor their dogs. Also, to eat flesh and white meat in Lent, so it be
done without hurting weak consciences, and without sedition; and likewise

<div class="sidenote">What Cranmer will do with the unpreaching friars.</div>

should serve forth their life-times; and he said they should serve it out
at a cart, then, for any other service they should have by that."</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph of this letter is of still greater interest. It
refers to the famous Vagrant Act, of which I have spoken in the first
chapter of this work.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vagrant Act the first fruits of the suppression.</div>

<p>"On Saturday in the Ember week, the King's Grace came in among the
burgesses of the parliament, and delivered them a bill, and bade them look
upon it, and weigh it in conscience; for he would not, he said, have them
pass either it or any other thing because his Grace giveth in the bill; but
they to see if it be for the commonweal of his subjects, and have an eye
thitherwards; and on Wednes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>day next he will be there again to hear their
minds. There shall be a proviso made for the poor people. The gaols shall
be rid; the faulty shall die; and the others shall be rid by proclamation
or by jury, and shall be set at liberty, and pay no fees. Sturdy beggars
and such prisoners as cannot be set at work, shall be set at work at the
king's charge; some at Dover, and some at places where the water hath
broken over the lands. Then, if they fall to idleness, the idler shall be
had before a justice of the peace, and his fault written. If he be taken
idle again in another place, he shall be known where his dwelling is; and
so at the second mention he shall be burned in the hand; and if he fail the
third time, he shall die for it."<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The king, as it appeared, had now the means at his disposal to find work
for the unemployed; and the lands bequeathed for the benefit of the poor
were reapplied, under altered forms, to their real intention. The
antithesis which we sometimes hear between the charity of the
monasteries&mdash;which relieved poverty for the love of God&mdash;and the worldly
harshness of a poor-law, will not endure inspection. The monasteries, which
had been the support of "valiant beggary," had long before transferred to
the nation the maintenance of the impotent and the deserving; and the
resumption of an abused trust was no more than the natural consequence of
their dishonesty. I have already discussed<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> the penal clauses of this
act, and I need not enter again upon that much-questioned subject. Never,
however, at any period,<span class="sidenote">The penal clauses of this statute.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
were the labouring classes in England more
generously protected than in the reign of Henry VIII.; never did any
government strain the power of legislation more resolutely in their favour;
and, I suppose, they would not themselves object to the re&euml;nactment of
Henry's penalties against dishonesty, if they might have with them the
shelter of Henry's laws.</p>

<p>The session was drawing to an end. At the close of it, the government gave
one more proof of their goodwill toward any portion of the church
establishment which showed signs of being alive. Duns Scotus being disposed
of in Bocardo, the idle residents being driven away, or compelled to employ
themselves, and the professors' lectures having recovered their energy,
there were hopes of good from Oxford and Cambridge; and the king conceded
<span class="sidenote">Payment of firstfruits remitted to the Universities.</span>
for them what the pope had never conceded, when the power rested with the
See of Rome: he remitted formally by statute the tenths and firstfruits,
which the colleges had paid in common with all other church corporations.
"His Majesty is conscious," says the act which was passed on this
occasion,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> that the enforcing of the payment of firstfruits against the
universities, "may prejudice learning, and cause the students to give their
minds to other things, which might not be acceptable to God;" and "he has
conceived such hearty love and tender affection to the continuance of
honest and virtuous living, and of the arts and sciences (wherewith it hath
pleased Almighty God abundantly to endow his Highness), as that his Grace
cannot compare the same to any law, constitution, or statute; nor tolerate
any such ordinance, though the commodity and benefit thereof should never
so much redound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> to his own profit or pleasure, if it may hinder the
advancement and setting forth of the lively word of God, wherewith his
people must be fed; or if it may imperil the knowledge of such other good
letters as in Christian realms is expedient to be learned. He has
therefore,&mdash;(for that the students should the more gladly bend their wits
to the attaining of learning, and, before all things, the learning of the
wholesome doctrines of Almighty God, and the three tongues, Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, which be requisite for the understanding of
Scripture,)&mdash;thought it convenient" to exonerate the universities from the
payment of firstfruits for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 4. Dissolution of the parliament, and summary of its
labours.</div>

<p>So closed the first great parliament of the Reformation, which was now
dissolved. The Lower House is known to us only as an abstraction. The
debates are lost; and the details of its proceedings are visible only in
faint transient gleams. We have an epitome of two sessions in the Lords'
Journals; but even this partial assistance fails us with the Commons; and
the Lords in this matter were a body of secondary moment. The Lords had
ceased to be the leaders of the English people; they existed as an ornament
rather than a power; and under the direction of the council they followed
as the stream drew them, when individually, if they had so dared, they
would have chosen a far other course. The work was done by the Commons; by
them the first move was made; by them and the king the campaign was carried
through to victory. And this one body of men, dim as they now seem to us,
who assembled on the wreck of the administration of Wolsey, had commenced
and had concluded a revolution which had reversed the foundations of the
State. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> found England in dependency upon a foreign power; they left it
a free nation. They found it under the despotism of a church establishment
saturated with disease; and they had bound the hands of that establishment;
they had laid it down under the knife, and carved away its putrid members;
and stripping off its Nessus robe of splendour and power, they had awakened
in it some forced remembrance of its higher calling. The elements of a far
deeper change were seething; a change, not in the disposition of outward
authority, but in the beliefs and convictions which touched the life of the
soul. This was yet to come; and the work so far was but the initial step or
prelude leading up to the more solemn struggle. Yet where the enemy who is
to be conquered is strong, not in vital force, but in the prestige of
authority, and in the enchanted defences of superstition, those truly win
the battle who strike the first blow, who deprive the idol of its terrors
by daring to defy it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="chaptsubhead">TRIAL AND DEATH OF ANNE BOLEYN.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The</span> first act of the great drama appeared to have closed. No further
changes were for the present in contemplation. The church was re&euml;stablished
under its altered constitution; and the parliament had been dissolved under
the impression that it would be unnecessary to summon another for an
indefinite time.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Within four weeks of the dissolution, writs were
issued for a fresh election, under the pressure of a misfortune which is
alike calamitous, under whatever aspect we regard it; and which blotted the
Reformation with a black and frightful stain. The guilt must rest where it
is due; but under any hypothesis, guilt there was, dark, mysterious, and
most miserable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Queen Catherine.</div>

<p>The fate of Queen Catherine had by this time completed itself. She had
taken her leave of a world which she had small cause to thank for the
entertainment which it had provided for her; and she died, as she had
lived, resolute, haughty, and unbending. In the preceding October (1535)
she was in bad health; her house, she imagined, disagreed with her, and at
her own desire she was removed to Kimbolton. But there were no symptoms of
immediate danger. She revived under the change, and was in better spirits
than she had shown for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> previous months, especially after she heard of
the new pope's resolution to maintain her cause. "Much resort of people
came daily to her."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> The vexatious dispute upon her title had been
dropped, from an inability to press it; and it seemed as if life had become
at least endurable to her, if it never could be more. But the repose was
but the stillness of evening as night is hastening down. The royal officers
of the household were not admitted into her presence; the queen lived
wholly among her own friends and her own people; she sank unperceived; and
so effectually had she withdrawn from the observation of those whom she
desired to exclude, that the king was left to learn from the Spanish
ambassador that she was at the point of death, before her chamberlain was
aware that she was more than indisposed.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> In the last week of December
Henry learnt that she was in danger. On the 2d of January the ambassador
went down from London to Kimbolton, and spent the day with her.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> On the
5th, Sir Edmund Bedingfield wrote that she was very ill, and that the issue
<span class="sidenote">January 7. Her last letter to Henry.</span>
was doubtful. On the morning of the 7th she received the last sacrament,
and at two o'clock on that day she died.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> On her deathbed she dictated
the following letter of farewell to him whom she still called, her most
dear lord and husband.</p>

<p>"The hour of my death now approaching, I cannot choose but, out of the love
I bear you, advise you of your soul's health, which you ought to prefer
before all considerations of the world or flesh whatsoever; for which yet
you have cast me into many calamities, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> yourself into many troubles.
But I forgive you all, and pray God to do so likewise. For the rest I
commend unto you Mary our daughter, beseeching you to be a good father to
her, as I have heretofore desired. I must entreat you also to respect my
maids, and give them in marriage, which is not much, they being but three;
and to all my other servants a year's pay besides their due, lest otherwise
they should be unprovided for. Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes
desire you above all things. Farewell."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>This letter reached Henry with the intimation that she was gone. He was
much affected, and is said to have shed tears.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">She is buried at Peterborough, and the See of Peterborough is
founded as a memorial of her.</div>

<p>The court was ordered into mourning&mdash;a command which Anne Boleyn
distinguished herself by imperfectly obeying.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Catherine was buried at
Peterborough, with the estate of Princess Royal;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> and shortly after, on
the foundation of the new bishoprics, the See of Peterborough was
established in her memory. We may welcome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> however late, these acts of
tardy respect.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Henry, in the few last years, had grown wiser in the
ways of women; and had learnt to prize more deeply the austerity of virtue,
even in its unloveliest aspect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Anne Boleyn.</div>

<p>The death of Catherine was followed, four months later, by the tragedy
which I have now to relate. The ground on which I am about to tread is so
critical, and the issues at stake affect so deeply the honour of many of
our most eminent English statesmen, that I must be pardoned if I cannot
here step boldly out with a flowing narrative, but must pick my way slowly
as I can: and I, on my part, must ask my readers to move slowly also, and
be content to allow their judgment, for a few pages, to remain in suspense.</p>

<p>And first, I have to say that, as with all the great events of Henry's
reign, so especially with this, we must trust to no evidence which is not
strictly contemporary. During periods of revolution, years do the work of
centuries in colouring actions and disturbing forms; and events are
transferred swiftly from the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>liberation of the judgment to the
precipitate arrogance of party spirit. When the great powers of Europe were
united against Elizabeth, and when Elizabeth's own character was vilely and
wantonly assailed, the Catholic writers dipped their pens in the stains
which blotted her mother's name; and, more careless of truth than even
theological passion can excuse, they poured out over both alike a stream of
indiscriminate calumny. On the other hand, as Elizabeth's lordly nature was
the pride of all true-hearted Englishmen, so the Reformers laboured to
reflect her virtues backwards. Like the Catholics, they linked the daughter
with the parent; and became no less extravagant in their panegyrics than
their antagonists in their gratuitous invective. But the Anne Boleyn, as
she appears in contemporary letters, is not the Anne Boleyn of Foxe, or
Wyatt, or the other champions of Protestantism, who saw in her the
counterpart of her child. These writers, though living so near to the
events which they described, yet were divided from the preceding generation
by an impassable gulf. They were surrounded with the heat and flame of a
controversy, in which public and private questions were wrapped inseparably
together; and the more closely we scrutinize their narratives, the graver
occasion there appears for doing so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rules to be observed in judging this question.</div>

<p>While, therefore, in following out this miserable subject, I decline so
much as to entertain the stories of Sanders, who has represented Queen Anne
as steeped in profligacy from her childhood, so I may not any more accept
those late memorials of her saintliness, which are alike unsupported by the
evidence of those who knew her. If Protestant legends are admitted as of
authority, the Catholic legends must enter with them, and we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> only
deepen the confusion. I cannot follow Burnet, in reporting out of Meteren a
version of Anne Boleyn's trial, unknown in England. The subject is one on
which rhetoric and rumour are alike unprofitable. We must confine ourselves
to accounts written at the time by persons to whom not the outline of the
facts only was known, but the circumstances which surrounded them; by
persons who had seen the evidence upon the alleged offences, which, though
now lost irrecoverably, can be proved to have once existed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of ascertaining Anne Boleyn's early character.</div>

<p>We are unable, as I early observed, to form any trustworthy judgment of
Anne Boleyn before her marriage. Her education had been in the worst school
in Europe. On her return from the French court to England, we have seen her
entangled in an unintelligible connexion with Lord Percy; and if the
account sent to the Emperor was true, she was Lord Percy's actual wife; and
her conduct was so criminal as to make any after-charges against her
credible.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>If the Protestants, again, found in her a friend and supporter, she was
capable, as Wolsey experienced, of inveterate hatred; and although among
the Reformers she had a reputation for generosity, which is widely
confirmed,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
yet it was exercised always in the direction in which her
interests pointed; and kindness of feeling is not incompatible, happily,
with seriously melancholy faults.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cranmer's evidence in her favour.</div>

<p>The strongest general evidence in her favour is that of Cranmer, who must
have known her intimately, and who, at the crisis of her life, declared
that he "never had better opinion in woman than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
he had in her."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Yet
there had been circumstances in her conduct, as by her own after
confessions was amply evident, which justified Sir Thomas More in
foretelling a stormy end to her splendour;<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Early coolness between her and Henry.</span>
and her relations with the
king, whether the fault rested with him, or rested with her, grew rapidly
cool when she was his wife. In 1534, perhaps sooner, both she herself, her
brother, and her relations had made themselves odious by their insolence;
her over-bearing manners had caused a decline in the king's affection for
her; and on one side it was reported that he was likely to return to
Catherine,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
on the other that he had transferred his attention to some
other lady, and that the court encouraged his inconstancy to separate him
from Anne's influence.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
D'Inteville confirms the account of a new love
affair, particularising nothing, but saying merely that Anne was falling
out of favour; and that the person alluded to as taking her place was Jane
Seymour, appears from a letter written after Anne's execution, by the
Regent Mary to the Emperor of Austria, and from the letter written
(supposing it genuine) by Anne herself to the king before her trial.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
On the other hand, it is equally clear that whether provoked or not by
infidelity on the part of Henry, her own conduct had been singularly
questionable. We know very little, but waiving for the present the
exposures at her trial, we know, by her own confession, that arrogance and
vanity had not been her only faults, and that she had permitted the
gentlemen who were the supposed partners of her guilt, to speak to her of
their passion for herself.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1535, Henry's mind had been filled with "doubts and strange
suspicions" about his wife. There had been a misunderstanding, in which she
had implored the intercession of Francis I.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The probable cause of that coolness.</div>

<p>In February, 1536, she miscarried, with a dead boy, which later rumour
dwelt on as the cause of Henry's displeasure. But conversations such as
those which she described with her supposed paramours, lay bare far deeper
wounds of domestic unhappiness; and assure us, that if we could look behind
the scenes, we should see there estrangements, quarrels, jealousies, the
thousand dreary incidents that, if we knew them, would break the suddenness
with which at present the catastrophe bursts upon us. It is the want of
preparation, the blank ignorance in which we are left of the daily life and
daily occurrences of the court, which places us at such disadvantage for
recovering the truth. We are unable to form any estimate whatever of those
antecedent likelihoods which, in the events of our own ordinary lives,
guide our judgment so imperceptibly, yet so surely. Henry is said to have
been inconstant, but those who most suspected Henry's motives charge Anne
at the same time with a long notorious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
profligacy.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
<span class="sidenote">The antecedent probabilities amount to nothing.</span>
We cannot say what
is probable or what is improbable; except, indeed, that the guilt or every
person is improbable antecedent to evidence; and in the present instance,
since, either on the side of the queen or of the king, there was and must
have been most terrible guilt, these opposite presumptions neutralize each
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April. Secret investigation by a committee of the privy
council.</div>

<p>To proceed with the story. Towards the middle of April, 1536, certain
members of the privy council were engaged secretly in receiving evidence
which implicated the queen in adultery. Nothing is known of the quarter
from which the information came which led to the
inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
Something,
however, there was to call for inquiry, or something there was thought to
be; and on the 24th of April the case was considered sufficiently complete
to make necessary a public trial. On that day an order was issued for a
special commission. The members of the tribunal were selected with a care
proportioned to the solemnity of the
occasion.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
It was composed of the
lord chancellor, the first noblemen of the realm, and of the judges. The
investigation had, however, been conducted so far with profound secrecy;
and the object for which it was to assemble was unknown even to Cranmer,
himself a member of the privy

With the same mysterious

a general election, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
parliament was required to assemble as soon as
possible.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
On Thursday, the 27th, the first arrest was made. Sir
William Brereton,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
a gentleman of the king's household, was sent
suddenly to the Tower; and on the Sunday after, Mark Smeton, of whom we
know only that he was a musician high in favour at the court, apparently a
spoilt favourite of royal
bounty.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
The day following was the 1st of
May. It was the day on which the annual festival was held at Greenwich, and
the queen appeared, as usual, with her husband and the court at the
tournament. Lord Rochfort, the queen's brother, and Sir Henry Norris, both
of them implicated in the fatal charge, were defender and challenger. The
tilting had commenced, when the king rose suddenly with signs of
disturbance in his manner, left the court, and rode off with a small
<span class="sidenote">The king goes to London.</span>
company to London. Rumour, which delights in dramatic explanations of great
occurrences, has discovered that a handkerchief dropped by the queen, and
caught by Norris, roused Henry's jealousy; and that his after conduct was
the result of a momentary anger. The incidents of the preceding week are a
sufficient reply to this romantic story. The mine was already laid, the
match was ready for the fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuesday, May 2; arrest of the queen. The privy council sit at
Greenwich.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
The king did not return: he passed the night in London, and Anne remained
at Greenwich. On the morning of Tuesday the privy council assembled in the
palace under the presidency of the Duke of Norfolk, and she was summoned to
appear before it. The Duke of Norfolk, her uncle, was anxious, as Burnet
insinuates, on political grounds that his niece should be made away with.
Such accusations are easily brought, especially when unsupported by
evidence. She was unpopular from her manner. The London merchants looked on
her with no favour as having caused a breach in the alliance with Flanders,
and the duke was an imperialist and at heart a friend of Queen Catherine;
but he had grown old in the service of the state with an unblemished
reputation; and he felt too keenly the disgrace which Anne's conduct had
<span class="sidenote">She declares her innocence.</span>
brought upon her family, to have contrived a scheme for her removal at once
so awkward and so ignominious.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
On her examination, she declared
herself innocent; the details of what passed are unknown; only she told Sir
William Kingston that she was cruelly handled at Greenwich with the king's
council; "and that the Duke of Norfolk, in answer to her defence, had said,
'Tut, tut, tut,' shaking his head three or four times."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> The other
prisoners were then examined;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> not Brereton, it would seem, but Smeton, who
<span class="sidenote">Norris, Weston, and Smeton examined.</span>
must have been brought down from the Tower, and Sir Henry Norris, and Sir
Francis Weston, two young courtiers, who had both of them been the trusted
friends of the king. Each day the shadow was stretching further. The worst
was yet to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 2. Tuesday. Smeton confesses, and Norris, who afterwards,
however, withdraws from what he has said.</div>

<p>On being first questioned, these three made general admissions, but denied
resolutely that any actual offence had been committed. On being pressed
further and cross-examined, Smeton confessed to actual adultery.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
Norris hesitated: being pressed, however, by Sir William Fitzwilliam to
speak the truth, he also made a similar acknowledgment, although he
afterwards withdrew from what he had said.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Weston persisted in
declaring himself innocent. The result was unsatisfactory, and it was
thought that it would "much touch the king's honour" if the guilt of the
accused was not proved more clearly. "Only Mark," Sir Edward Baynton said,
would confess "of any actual thing"<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>; although he had no doubt "the
other two" were "as fully culpable as ever was he." They were, however, for
the present, recommitted to the Tower; whither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> also in the afternoon the
council conducted the queen, and left her in the custody of Sir William
Kingston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The queen, in the afternoon, is taken to the Tower.</div>

<p>She was brought up the river; the same river along which she sailed in
splendour only three short years before. She landed at the same Tower
Stairs; and, as it to complete the bitter misery of the change, she was
taken "to her own lodgings in which she lay at her coronation." She had
feared that she was to go to a dungeon. When Kingston told her that these
rooms had been prepared for her, "It is too good for me," she said, "Jesu
have mercy on me;" "and kneeled down, weeping a great space; and in the
same sorrow fell into a great
<span class="sidenote">She protests her innocence, and begs to have the sacrament in
her closet.</span>
laughing."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
She then begged that she
might have the sacrament in the closet by her chamber, that she might pray
for mercy, declaring "that she was free from the company of man as for
sin," and was "the king's true wedded wife."</p>

<p>She was aware that the other prisoners were in the Tower, or, at least,
that Smeton, Weston, and Norris were there. Whether she knew at that time
of the further dreadful accusation which was hanging over her, does not
appear; but she asked anxiously for her brother; and, if she had suspected
anything, her fears must have been confirmed by Kingston's evasive replies.
It is so painful to dwell upon the words and actions of a poor woman in her
moments of misery, that Kingston may describe his conversation with her in
his own words. Lord Rochfort had returned to London at liberty; he seems to
have been arrested the same Tuesday afternoon. "I pray you," she said, "to
tell me where my Lord Rochfort is?"&mdash;"I told her,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> Kingston wrote, that "I
saw him afore dinner, in the court." "Oh, where is my sweet brother?" she
went on. "I said I left him at York-place;" and so I did. "I hear say,"
said she, "that I should be accused with three men; and I can say no more
but nay, without I should open my body,"&mdash;and therewith she opened her
gown, saying, "Oh, Norris, hast thou accused me? Thou art in the Tower with
me, and thou and I shall die together. And, Mark, thou art here too. Oh, my
mother, thou wilt die for sorrow." And much she lamented my Lady of
Worcester, for because her child did not stir in her body. And my wife
said, "What should be the cause?" She said, "For the sorrow she took for
me." And then she said, "Mr. Kingston, shall I die without justice?" And I
said, "The poorest subject the king hath, had justice;" and therewith she
laughed.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lady Boleyn and three other ladies sent to attend upon her.</div>

<p>Lady Boleyn, her aunt, had been sent for, with a Mrs. Cousins, and two
other ladies, selected by the king.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> They were ordered to attend upon
the queen, but to observe a strict silence; and to hold no communication
with her, except in the presence of Lady Kingston. This regulation, it was
found, could not be insisted on. Lady Boleyn and Mrs. Cousins slept in the
queen's room, and conversation could not be prevented. Mrs. Cousins
undertook, on her part, to inform Kingston if anything was said which "it
was meet that he should know."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wednesday, May 3. Reported conversation of the queen with

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
In compliance with this promise, she told him, the next morning, that the
queen had been speaking to her about Norris. On the preceding Sunday, she
said that Norris had offered to "swear for the queen, that she was a good
woman."&mdash;"But how," asked Mrs. Cousins, very naturally, "how came any such
things to be spoken of at all?"&mdash;"Marry," the queen said, "I bade him do
so: for I asked him why he went not through with his marriage; and he made
answer, that he would tarry a time. Then, I said, You look for dead men's
shoes; for if aught came to the king but good, you would look to have
me.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> And he said, if he should have any such thought, he would his head
<span class="sidenote">And with Sir Francis Weston.</span>
were off. And then she said she could undo him, if she would. And therewith
they fell out." "But she said she more feared Weston; for on Whitsun
Tuesday last, Weston told her that Norris came more unto her chamber for
her than for Mage."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Afterwards, "The queen spake of Weston, that she
had spoken to him, because he did love her kinswoman, Mrs. Skelton, and
that she said he loved not his wife; and he made answer to her again, that
he loved one in her house better than them both. She asked him who is that?
to which he answered, that it is yourself. 'And then,' she said, 'she
defied him.'"<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
So passed Wednesday at the Tower. Let us feel our very utmost
commiseration for this unhappy woman; if she was guilty, it is the more
reason that we should pity her; but I am obliged to say, that conversations
of this kind, admitted by herself, disentitle her to plead her character in
answer to the charges against her. Young men do not speak of love to young
and beautiful married women, still less to ladies of so high rank, unless
something more than levity has encouraged them; and although to have
permitted such language is no proof of guilt, yet it is a proof of the
absence of innocence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The news reaches Cranmer. He is ordered to Lambeth till he hears
further.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the Tuesday morning, a rumour of the queen's arrest was rife
in London; and the news for the first time reached the ears of Cranmer. The
archbishop was absent from home, but in the course of the day he received
an order, through Cromwell, to repair to his palace, and remain there till
he heard further. With what thoughts he obeyed this command may be gathered
from the letter which, on the following morning, he wrote to Henry. The
fortunes of the Reformation had been so closely linked to those of the
queen, that he trembled for the consequences to the church of the king's
too just indignation. If the barren womb of Catherine had seemed a judgment
against the first marriage, the shameful issue of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span> second might be
regarded too probably as a witness against that and against every act which
had been connected with it. Full of these forebodings, yet not too wholly
occupied with them to forget the unhappy queen, he addressed the king,
early on Wednesday, in the following language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">He writes to the king. He implores Henry to bear his misfortune
like a man,</div>

<p>"Please it your most noble Grace to be advertised, that at your Grace's
commandment, by Mr. Secretary's letter, written in your Grace's name, I
came to Lambeth yesterday, and there I do remain to know your Grace's
further pleasure. And forasmuch as without your Grace's commandment, I dare
not, contrary to the contents of the said letter, presume to come unto your
Grace's presence; nevertheless, of my most bounden duty, I can do no less
than most humbly to desire your Grace, by your great wisdom, and by the
assistance of God's help, somewhat to suppress the deep sorrows of your
Grace's heart, and to take all adversities of God's hands both patiently
and thankfully. I cannot deny but your Grace hath good cause many ways of
lamentable heaviness; and also, that in the wrongful estimation of the
world, your Grace's honour of every part is so highly touched (whether the
things that commonly be spoken of be true or not), that I remember not that
ever Almighty God sent unto your Grace any like occasion to try your
<span class="sidenote">And to accept submissively the trial which God has sent upon
him.</span>
Grace's constancy throughout, whether your Highness can be content to take
of God's hands as well things displeasant as pleasant. And if He find in
your most noble heart such an obedience unto his will, that your Grace,
without murmuration and over-much heaviness, do accept all adversities, not
less thanking Him than when all things succeed after your Grace's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span> will and
pleasure, then I suppose your Grace did never thing more acceptable unto
Him since your first governance of this your realm. And moreover, your
Grace shall give unto Him occasion to multiply and increase his graces and
benefits unto your Highness, as He did unto his most faithful servant Job;
unto whom, after his great calamities and heaviness, for his obedient heart
and willing acceptation of God's scourge and rod, addidit Dominus cuncta
duplicia. And if it be true that is openly reported of the Queen's Grace,
if men had a right estimation of things, they should not esteem any part of
your Grace's honour to be touched thereby; but her honour to be clean
disparaged. And I am in such perplexity, that my mind is clean amazed; for
I never had better opinion in woman than I had in her; which maketh me to
think that she should not be culpable. And again, I think your Highness
would not have gone so far, except she had been surely culpable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the queen's guilt, he knows not what to believe.<br /><br />
He will pray that she may be found innocent.</div>

<p>"Now I think that your Grace best knoweth that, next unto your Grace, I was
most bound unto her of all creatures living. Wherefore, I most humbly
beseech your Grace to suffer me in that which both God's law, nature, and
also her kindness bindeth me unto: that is, that I may with your Grace's
favour wish and pray for her that she may declare herself inculpable and
innocent. And if she be found culpable, considering your Grace's goodness
to her, and from what condition your Grace of your only mere goodness took
her, and set the crown upon her head, I repute him not your Grace's
faithful servant and subject, nor true unto the realm, that would not
desire the offence without mercy to be punished, to the example of all
other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">But if she be guilty, let her be punished with all extremity,
for the dishonour which she has brought upon the gospel.</span>
And as I loved her not a little for the love which I judged her to
bear towards God and his gospel; so if she be proved culpable, there is not
one that loveth God and his gospel that will ever favour her, but must hate
her above all other; and the more they favour the gospel, the more they
will hate her; for there never was creature in our time that so much
slandered the gospel. And God hath sent her this punishment for that she
feignedly hath professed his gospel in her mouth, and not in heart and
deed. And though she hath offended so that she hath deserved never to be
reconciled to your Grace's favour, yet Almighty God hath manifoldly
declared his goodness towards your Grace, and never offended you. But your
<span class="sidenote">He trusts that the king will still continue to favour the
gospel, however, as before.</span>
Grace, I am sure, acknowledgeth that you have offended Him. Wherefore, I
trust that your Grace will bear no less entire favour unto the truth of the
gospel than you did before; forasmuch as your Grace's favour to the gospel
was not led by affection unto her, but by zeal unto the truth. And thus I
beseech Almighty God, whose gospel he hath ordained your Grace to be
defender of, ever to preserve your Grace from all evil, and give you at the
end the promise of his gospel. From Lambeth, the third of May."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />He is sent for to the Star Chamber.<br /><br />
The postscript of his letter.</div>

<p>The letter was written; it was not, however, sent upon the instant; and in
the course of the morning the archbishop was requested to meet the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Oxford, Lord Sussex, and the Lord Chamberlain, in the Star
Chamber. He went, and on his return to Lambeth he added a few words in a
postscript. In the interview from which he had at the moment returned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
those noblemen, he said, had declared unto him such things as his Grace's
pleasure was they should make him privy unto; for the which he was most
bounden unto his Grace. "What communications we had together," he added, "I
doubt not but they will make the true report thereof unto your Grace. <i>I am
exceedingly sorry that such faults can be proved by the queen, as I heard
of their relation.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>If we may believe, as I suppose we may, that Cranmer was a man of sound
understanding, and of not less than ordinary probity, this letter is of the
greatest value; it shows the impression which was made upon a sensible
person by the first rumours of the discovery; it shows also the
archbishop's opinion of the king's character, with the effect upon his own
mind of the evidence which the chancellor, at the king's command, had laid
before him.</p>

<p>We return to the prisoners in the Tower. Mark Smeton, who had confessed his
guilt, was ironed.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> The other gentlemen, not in consideration of their
silence, but of their rank, were treated more leniently. To the queen, with
<span class="sidenote">Friday, May 5. Henry writes to the queen with a promise of
pardon if she will confess.</span>
an object which may be variously interpreted, Henry wrote the Friday
succeeding her arrest, holding out hopes of forgiveness if she would be
honest and open with him. Persons who assume that the whole transaction was
the scheme of a wicked husband to dispose of a wife of whom he was weary,
will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
believe that he was practising upon her terror to obtain his freedom
by a lighter crime than murder. Those who consider that he possessed the
ordinary qualities of humanity, and that he was really convinced of her
guilt, may explain his offer as the result of natural feeling. But in
<span class="sidenote">She persists in maintaining her innocence,<br /><br />
Being satisfied that there was no witness of her guilt.</span>
whatever motive his conduct originated, it was ineffectual. Anne, either
knowing that she was innocent, or trusting that her guilt could not be
proved, trusting, as Sir Edmund Baynton thought, to the constancy of Weston
and Norris,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> declined to confess anything. "<i>If any man accuse me</i>,"

<div class="sidenote">Saturday, May 6. Her letter to the king.</div>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Your Grace's displeasure and my imprisonment are things so strange
unto me, as what to write,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span> or what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant.
Whereas you send unto me (willing [me] to confess a truth, and to obtain
your favour) by such an one whom you know to be mine antient professed
enemy, I no sooner conceived this message by him, than I rightly conceived
your meaning; and if, as you say, confessing a truth indeed may procure my
safety, I shall with all willingness and duty perform your command.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Never prince had more loyal wife.</div>

<p>"But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor wife will ever be
brought to acknowledge a fault where not so much as a thought thereof
proceeded. And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in all
duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn;
with which name and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God
and your Grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so
far forget myself in my exaltation or received queenship, but that I always
<span class="sidenote">She, however, always looked for what now she finds.</span>
looked for such an alteration as now I find: for the ground of my
preferment being on no surer foundation than your Grace's fancy, the least
alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other
subject. You have chosen me from a low estate to be your queen and
companion, far beyond my desert or desire. If then you found me worthy of
such honour, good your Grace, let not any light fancy or bad counsel of
mine enemies withdraw your princely favour from me; neither let that stain,
that unworthy stain, of a disloyal heart towards your good Grace, ever cast
so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife, and the infant princess, your
daughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She begs for a fair trial,</div>

<p>"Try me, good king, but let me have a lawful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> trial; and let not my sworn
enemies sit as my accusers and my judges; yea, let me receive an open
trial, for my truth shall fear no open shame. Then shall you see either
mine innocency cleared, your suspicions and conscience satisfied, the
<span class="sidenote">And if she is condemned, Henry may lawfully follow his new
fancy.</span>
ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my guilt openly declared; so
that, whatsoever God or you may determine of me, your Grace may be freed
from an open censure; and mine offence being so lawfully proved, your Grace
is at liberty, both before God and man, not only to execute worthy
punishment on me, as an unlawful wife, but to follow your affection already
settled on that party for whose sake I am now as I am, whose name I could
some good while since have pointed unto; your Grace not being ignorant of
my suspicion therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If her fate is already decided, she prays God will pardon his
great sin,</div>

<p>"But if you have already determined of me; and that not only my death, but
an infamous slander, must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness;
then I desire of God that he will pardon your great sin therein, and
likewise my enemies the instruments thereof; and that He will not call you
to a strict account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his
general judgment-seat, where both you and myself must shortly appear; and
in whose judgment, I doubt not, whatsoever the world may think of me, mine
innocence shall be openly known and sufficiently cleared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And also that her own death may suffice, and the poor gentlemen
be spared.</div>

<p>"My last and only request shall be, that myself may only bear the burden of
your Grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch the innocent souls of
those poor gentlemen who, as I understand, are likewise in strait
impris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>onment for my sake. If ever I have found favour in your sight, if
ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me
obtain this request; and I will so leave to trouble your Grace any further;
with mine earnest prayers to the Trinity, to have your Grace in his good
keeping, and to direct you in all your actions. From my doleful prison in
the Tower, this 6th of May. Your most loyal and ever faithful wife,<br />

<p>This letter is most affecting; and although it is better calculated to
plead the queen's cause with posterity than with the king, whom it could
only exasperate, yet if it is genuine it tells (so far as such a
composition can tell at all) powerfully in her favour. On the same page of
<span class="sidenote">A second requisition to confess from the king, and a second
refusal.<br /><br />
The tone of the queen's answers not what it ought to have been,
even on her own showing.</span>
the manuscript, carrying the same authority, and subject to the same doubt,
is a fragment of another letter, supposed to have been written
subsequently, and therefore in answer to a second invitation to confess. In
this she replied again, that she could confess no more than she had already
spoken; that she might conceal nothing from the king, to whom she did
acknowledge herself so much bound for so many favours; for raising her
first from a mean woman to be a marchioness; next to be his queen; and now,
seeing he could bestow no further honours upon her on earth, for purposing
by martyrdom to make her a saint in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> This answer also was
unwise in point of worldly prudence; and I am obliged showing to add, that
the tone which was assumed, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span> in this and in her first letter, was
unbecoming (even if she was innocent of actual sin) in a wife who, on her
own showing, was so gravely to blame. It is to be remembered that she had
betrayed from the first the king's confidence; and, as she knew at the
moment at which she was writing, she had never been legally married to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her wild words in the Tower.</div>

<p>Her spirits meanwhile had something rallied, though still violently
fluctuating. "One hour," wrote Kingston,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> "she is determined to die,
and the next hour much contrary to that." Sometimes she talked in a wild,
wandering way, wondering whether any one made the prisoners' beds, with
other of those light trifles which women's minds dwell upon so strangely,
when strained beyond their strength. "There would be no rain," she said,
"till she was out of the Tower; and if she died, they would see the
greatest punishment for her that ever came to England." "And then," she
added, "I shall be a saint in heaven, for I have done many good deeds in my
days; but I think it much unkindness in the king to put such about me as I
never loved."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Kingston was a hard chronicler, too convinced of the
queen's guilt to feel compassion for her; and yet these rambling fancies
are as touching as Ophelia's; and, unlike hers, are no creation of a poet's
imagination, but words once truly uttered by a poor human being in her hour
of agony. Yet they proved nothing. And if her wanderings seem to breathe of
innocence, they are yet compatible with the absence of it. We must remind
ourselves that two of the prisoners had already confessed both their own
guilt and hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations for the trial. Necessity of entering into offensive
details.</div>

<p>The queen demanded a trial; it was not necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span> to ask for it. Both she
and her supposed accomplices were tried with a scrupulousness without a
parallel, so far as I am aware, in the criminal records of the time. The
substance of the proceedings is preserved in an official summary;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and
distressing as it is to read of such sad matters, the importance of
arriving at a fair judgment must excuse the details which will be entered
into. The crime was alike hideous, whether it was the crime of the queen or
of Henry; we may not attempt to hide from ourselves the full deformity of
it.</p>

<p>On the 24th of April, then, a special commission was appointed, to try
certain persons for offences committed at London, at Hampton Court, and at
the palace at Greenwich. The offences in question having been committed in
Middlesex and in Kent, bills were first to be returned by the grand juries
of both counties.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br /><br />The names of the commissioners appointed to try the queen's
accomplices.</div>

<p>Men are apt to pass vaguely over the words "a commission" or "a jury,"
regarding them rather as mechanical abstractions than as bodies of
responsible men. I shall therefore give the list of the persons who, in
these or any other capacities, were engaged upon the trials. The special
commission consisted of Sir Thomas Audeley, the lord chancellor; the Duke
of Norfolk, uncle of the queen and of Lord Rochfort; the Duke of Suffolk,
the king's brother-in-law; the Earl of Wiltshire, the queen's father; the
Earls of Oxford, Westmoreland, and Sussex; Lord Sandys; Thomas Cromwell;
Sir William Fitzwilliam the Lord High
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
Admiral, an old man whose career had
been of the most distinguished brilliancy; Sir William Paulet, lord
treasurer, afterwards Marquis of Winchester; and, finally, the nine judges
of the Courts of Westminster, Sir John Fitzjames, Sir John Baldewyn, Sir
Richard Lister, Sir John Porte, Sir John Spelman, Sir Walter Luke, Sir
Anthony Fitzherbert, Sir Thomas Englefield, and Sir William Shelley. The
<span class="sidenote">The queen and her brother to be tried by the House of
Lords.</span>
duty of this tribunal was to try the four commoners accused of adultery
with the queen. She herself, with her brother, would be tried by the House
of Lords. Of the seven peers, three were her own nearest connexions; the
remaining commissioners were those who, individually and professionally,
might have been considered competent for the conduct of the cause above all
other persons in the realm. Antecedently to experience, we should not have
expected that a commission so constituted would have lent itself to a
conspiracy; and if foul play had been intended, we should have looked to
see some baser instruments selected for so iniquitous a purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wednesday, May 10. True bill found by the grand jury of

<p>In the middle of the second week in May, the grand juries had completed

of Giles Heron, Esq.; Roger More, Esq.; Richard Awnsham, Esq.; Thomas
Byllyngton, Esq.; Gregory Lovel, Esq.; John Worsop, Esq.; William Goddard,

Edmund Page, gentleman; Thomas Fereby, gentleman; and Lionel Ansty,
gentleman.</p>

<p>I am thus particular in recording the names of these jurors, before I
relate the indictment which was found by them, because, if that indictment
was unjust, it stamps their memory with eternal infamy; and with the
judges, the commissioners, the privy council, the king, with every living
person who was a party, active or passive, to so enormous a calumny, they
must be remembered with shame for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The indictment.</div>

<p>The indictment, then, found by the grand jury of Middlesex was to the
following effect:<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>"1. That the Lady Anne, Queen of England, having been the wife of the king
for the space of three years and more, she, the said Lady Anne, contemning
the marriage so solemnized between her and the king, and bearing malice in
her heart against the king, and following her frail and carnal lust, did
falsely and traitorously procure, by means of indecent language, gifts, and
other acts therein stated, divers of the king's daily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> and familiar
servants to be her adulterers and concubines; so that several of the king's
servants, by the said queen's most vile provocation and invitation, became
given and inclined to the said queen.</p>

<p>"2. That the queen [on the] 6th of October, 25 Hen. VIII. [1533], at
Westminster, by words, &amp;c., procured and incited one Henry Norris, Esq.,
one of the gentlemen of the king's privy chamber, to have illicit
intercourse with her; and that the act was committed at Westminster, 12th
October, 25 Hen. VIII.</p>

<p>"3. That the queen, 2nd of November, 27 Hen. VIII. [1535], by the means
therein stated, procured and incited George Boleyn, knight, Lord Rochfort,
her own natural brother, to have illicit intercourse with her; and that the
act was committed 5th of November in the same year, at Westminster, against
the commands of Almighty God, and all laws human and divine.</p>

<p>"4. That the queen, 3rd December, 25 Hen. VIII., procured and incited
William Brereton, Esq., one of the gentlemen of the king's privy chamber,
to have illicit intercourse with her; and that the act was committed at
Hampton Court, 25th December, 25 Hen. VIII.</p>

<p>"5. That the queen, 8th of May, 26 Hen. VIII., procured and incited Francis
Weston, one of the gentlemen of the king's privy chamber, to have illicit
intercourse with her; and that the act was committed at Westminster, 20th
May, 26 Hen. VIII.</p>

<p>"6. That the queen, 12th of April, 26 Hen. VIII., procured and incited Mark
Smeton, Esq., one of the grometers of the king's chamber, to have illicit
intercourse with her; and that the act was committed at Westminster, 26th
April, 26 Henry VIII.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
"7. Furthermore, that the said George, Lord Rochfort, Henry Norris, William
Brereton, Sir Francis Weston, and Mark Smeton, being thus inflamed by
carnal love of the queen, and having become very jealous of each other,
did, in order to secure her affections, satisfy her inordinate desires; and
that the queen was equally jealous of the Lord Rochfort and other the
before-mentioned traitors; and she would not allow them to show any
familiarity with any other woman, without her exceeding displeasure and
indignation; and that on the 27th day of November, 27 Hen. VIII., and other
days, at Westminster, she gave them gifts and great rewards, to inveigle
them to her will.</p>

<p>"8. Furthermore, that the queen, and other the said traitors, jointly and
severally, 31st of October, 27 Hen. VIII., and at various times before and
after, compassed and imagined the king's death; and that the queen had
frequently promised to marry some one of the traitors, whenever the king
should depart this life, affirming she never would love the king in her
heart.</p>

<p>"9. Furthermore, that the king, having within a short time before become
acquainted with the before-mentioned crimes, vices, and treasons, had been
so grieved that certain harms and dangers had happened to his royal
body."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>I suppose that persons who have made up their minds conclusively, and are
resolved to abide by the popular verdict of English historians, will turn
with disgust from these hideous charges; seeming, as they do, to overstep
all ordinary bounds of credibility. On one side or the other there was
indeed no common
<span class="sidenote">The improbability of the queen's guilt and the improbability of
a conspiracy against her increase in the same ratio.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
guilt. The colours deepen at every step. But it is to be
remembered that if the improbability of crimes so revolting is becoming
greater, the opposite improbability increases with equal strength&mdash;that
English noblemen and gentlemen could have made themselves a party to the
invention of the story. For invention is unfortunately the only word; would
indeed that any other were admissible! The discovery of the indictment
disposes at once of Burnet's legend, that the queen was condemned on
hearsay evidence; or that her guilt was conjectured from an exaggerated
<span class="sidenote">There is no room for the hypothesis of mistake.</span>
report of foolish conversations. It cuts off all hope, too, of possible
mistake. I have heard the name Leontes mentioned as a parallel to Henry;
and if the question lay only between the king and his wife, we would gladly
welcome the alternative. Charity would persuade us that a husband had been
madly blind, sooner far than that a queen had been madly wicked. But this
<span class="sidenote">The parallel of Leontes suggested, but not
admissible.</span>
road for escape is closed. The mistake of Leontes was transparent to every
eye but his own. The charges against Anne Boleyn were presented by two
grand juries before the highest judicial tribunal in the realm. There was
nothing vague, nothing conjectural. The detail was given of acts and
conversations stretching over a period of two years and more; and either
there was evidence for these things, or there was none. If there was
evidence, it must have been close, elaborate, and minute; if there was
none, these judges, these juries and noblemen, were the accomplices of the
king in a murder perhaps the most revolting which was ever committed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The difficulty in the way of supposing the accusations forged.</div>

<p>It may be thought that the evidence was pieced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span> together in the secrets of
the cabinet; that the juries found their bills on a case presented to them
by the council. This would transfer the infamy to a higher stage; but if we
try to imagine how the council proceeded in such a business, we shall not
find it an easy task. The council, at least, could not have been deceived.
The evidence, whatever it was, must have been examined by them; and though
we stretch our belief in the complacency of statesmen to the furthest limit
of credulity, can we believe that Cromwell would have invented that dark
indictment,&mdash;Cromwell who was, and who remained till his death, the dearest
friend of Latimer? Or the Duke of Norfolk, the veteran who had won his
spurs at Flodden? Or the Duke of Suffolk and Sir William Fitzwilliam, the
Wellington and the Nelson of the sixteenth century? Scarcely among the
picked scoundrels of Newgate could men be found for such work; and shall we
believe it of men like these? It is to me impossible. Yet, if it was done
at all, it was done by those four ministers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To what purpose the multiplication of offences, and the number
of offenders?</div>

<p>Even if we could believe that they forged the accusations, yet they would
at least limit the dimensions of them. The most audacious villain will not
extend his crimes beyond what he requires for his object; and if the king
desired only to rid himself of his wife, to what purpose the multiplication
of offenders, and the long list of acts or guilt, when a single offence
with the one accomplice who was ready to abide by a confession would have
sufficed? The four gentlemen gratuitously, on this hypothesis, entangled in
the indictment, were nobly connected: one of them, Lord Rochfort, was
himself a peer; they had lived, all four, several years at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span> court, and
were personally known to every member of the council. Are we to suppose
that evidence was invented with no imaginable purpose, for wanton and
needless murders?&mdash;that the council risked the success of their scheme, by
multiplying charges which only increased difficulty of proof, and provoked
the interference of the powerful relations of the accused?<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the difficulties in which, at this early stage of the transaction,
we are already implicated. They will not diminish as we proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Friday, May 12. The court opens.<br /><br />
The four commoners are brought to the bar.<br /><br />
A petty jury return a verdict of guilty.</div>

<p>Friday, the 12th of May, was fixed for the opening of the court. On that
day, a petty jury was returned at Westminster, for the trial of Sir Henry
Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William Brereton, and Mark Smeton. The
commission sat,&mdash;the Earl of Wiltshire sitting with them,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>&mdash;and the
four prisoners were brought to the bar. On their arraignment, Mark Smeton,
we are told, pleaded guilty of adultery with the queen; not guilty of the
other charges. Norris, Weston, and Brereton severally pleaded not guilty.
Verdict, guilty. The king's sergeant and attorney pray judgment. Judgment
upon Smeton, Norris, Weston, and Brereton as usual in cases of high
treason. This is all which the record contains. The nature of the evidence
is not mentioned. But again there was a jury; and if we have not the
evidence which convinced that jury, we have the evidence that they were, or
professed to be, convinced.</p>

<p>The queen and her brother were to be tried on the following Monday. Their
crime was not adultery only, but was coloured with the deeper stain of
incest. On the Friday, while the other prisoners were at the bar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span> "Letters
patent were addressed to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Treasurer and Earl
Marshal of England, setting forth that the Lady Anne, Queen of England, and
Sir George Boleyn, knight, Lord Rochfort, had been indicted of certain
capital crimes; and that the king, considering that justice was a most
excellent virtue, and pleasing to the Most Highest; and inasmuch as the
<span class="sidenote">The Duke of Norfolk is named Lord High Steward.</span>
office of High Steward of England, whose presence for the administration of
the law in this case is required, was vacant, the king therefore appointed
the said duke Lord High Steward of England, with full powers to receive the
indictments found against Queen Anne and the Lord Rochfort, and calling
them before him, for the purpose of hearing and examining them, and
compelling them to answer thereto." The duke was to collect also "such and
so many lords, peers, and magnates of the kingdom of England, peers of the
said Queen Anne and Lord Rochfort, by whom the truth could be better known;
and the truth being known, to give judgment according to the laws and
customs of England, and to give sentence and judgment, and to direct
execution, with the other usual powers."<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> As a certain number only of

Essex, Cumberland, and Wiltshire. Why the first three were omitted I do not

his two children. The remaining peers were the Lords Audeley, De la Ware,

proceeding as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before the Lord High Steward at the Tower, Anne, Queen of England, comes

Suffolk, Marquis of Exeter, and others the before-mentioned earls and
barons, peers of the said queen, being charged by the said Lord High
Steward to say the truth, and afterwards being examined severally by the
Lord High Steward, from the lowest peer to the highest, each of them

In such cold lines is the story of this tragedy unrolling itself to its
close. The course which it followed, however, was less hard in the actual
life; and men's hearts, even in those stern times, could beat with human
emotions. The Duke of Norfolk was in tears as he passed sentence.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The
Earl of Northumberland "was obliged by a sudden illness to leave the
court."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The sight of the woman whom he had once loved, and to whom he
was perhaps married, in that dreadful position, had been more than he could
bear; and the remainder of the work of the day went forward without him.</p>

We can form no estimate of the evidence; for we do not know what it was. We
cannot especially accuse the form of the trial; for it was the form which
was always observed. But the fact remains to us, that these twenty-seven
peers, who were not ignorant, as we are, but were fully acquainted with the
grounds of the prosecution, did deliberately, after hearing the queen's
defence, pronounce against her a unanimous verdict. If there was foul play,
they had advantages infinitely greater than any to which we can pretend for
detecting it. The Boleyns were unpopular, and Anne herself was obnoxious to
the imperialists and Catholics; but all parties, Catholic and Protestant
alike, united in the sentence.</p>

<p>Looking at the case, then, as it now stands, we have the report for some
time current, that the queen was out of favour, and that the king's
affection was turned in another direction,&mdash;a report, be it observed, which
had arisen before the catastrophe, and was not, therefore, an afterthought,
or legend; we have also the antecedent improbability, which is very great,
that a lady in the queen's position could have been guilty of the offences
with which the indictment charges her. We have also the improbability,
which is great, that the king, now forty-four years old, who in his earlier
years had been distinguished for the absence of those vices in which
contemporary princes indulged themselves, in wanton weariness of a woman
for whom he had revolutionized the kingdom, and quarrelled with half
Christendom, suddenly resolved to murder her; that, instead of resorting to
poison, or to the less obtrusive methods of criminality, he invented, and
persuaded his council to assist him in inventing, a series of accusations
which reflected dishonour on himself, and which involved the gratuitous
death of five persons with whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
he had no quarrel, who were attached to
his court and person. To maintain these accusations, he would have to
overawe into an active participation in his crime, judges, juries, peers,
the dearest relations of those whom he was destroying, and this with no
standing army, no pr&aelig;torians or janissaries at his back, with no force but
the yeomen of the guard, who could be scattered by a rising of the
apprentices. He had gone out of his way, moreover, to call a parliament;
and the summons had been so hasty that no time was left to control the
<span class="sidenote">The popular interpretation is not credible.</span>
elections; while again to fail was ruin; and the generation of Englishmen
to whom we owe the Reformation were not so wholly lost to all principles of
honour, that Henry could have counted beforehand upon success in so
desperate a scheme with that absolute certainty without which he would
scarcely have risked the experiment. I think that there is some
improbability here. Unlikely as it is that queens should disgrace
themselves, history contains unfortunately more than one instance that it
is not impossible. That queens in that very age were capable of profligacy
was proved, but a few years later, by the confessions of Catherine Howard.
I believe history will be ransacked vainly to find a parallel for conduct
at once so dastardly, so audacious, and so foolishly wicked as that which
the popular hypothesis attributes to Henry VIII.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The facts in favour of the queen.</div>

<p>This is a fair statement of the probabilities; not, I believe, exaggerated
on either side. Turning to the positive facts which are known to us, we
have amongst those which make for the queen her own denial of her guilt;
her supposed letter to the king, which wears the complexion of innocence;
the assertions of three out of the five other persons who were accused, up
to the moment of their execution;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span> and the sympathizing story of a Flemish
gentleman who believed her innocent, and who says that many other people in
England believed the same. On the other side, we have the judicial verdict
of more than seventy noblemen and gentlemen,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> no one of whom had any
<span class="sidenote">The facts against her.</span>
interest in the deaths of the accused, and some of whom had interests the
most tender in their acquittal; we have the assent of the judges who sat on
the commission, and who passed sentence, after full opportunities of
examination, with all the evidence before their eyes; the partial
confession of one of the prisoners, though afterwards withdrawn; and the
complete confession of another, maintained till the end, and not withdrawn
upon the scaffold. Mr. Hallam must pardon me for saying that this is not a
matter in which doubt is unpermitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wednesday, May 17. The execution of the five gentlemen.</div>

<p>A brief interval only was allowed between the judgment and the final close.
On Wednesday, the 17th, the five gentlemen were taken to execution. Smeton
was hanged; the others were beheaded. Smeton and Brereton acknowledged the
justice of their sentence. Brereton said that if he had to die a thousand
deaths, he deserved them all; and Brereton was the only one of the five
whose guilt at the time was doubted.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Norris died silent; Weston, with
a few general lamentations on the wickedness of his past life. None denied
the crime for which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span> suffered; all but one were considered by the
spectators to have confessed. Rochfort had shown some feeling while in the
Tower. Kingston on one occasion found him weeping bitterly. The day of the
trial he sent a petition to the king, to what effect I do not learn; and on
the Tuesday he begged to see Cromwell, having something on his conscience,
as he said, which he wished to tell him.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> His desire, however, does not
seem to have been complied with; he spoke sorrowfully on the scaffold of
the shame which he had brought upon the gospel, and died with words which
appeared to the spectators, if not a confession, yet something very nearly
resembling it, "This said lord," wrote a spectator to the court at
Brussels, "made a good Catholic address to the people. He said that he had
not come there to preach to them, but rather to serve as a mirror and an
example. He acknowledged the crimes which he had committed against God, and
against the king his sovereign; there was no occasion for him, he said, to
repeat the cause for which he was condemned; they would have little
pleasure in hearing him tell it. He prayed God, and he prayed the king, to
pardon his offences; and all others whom he might have injured he also
prayed to forgive him as heartily as he forgave every one. He bade his
hearers avoid the vanities of the world, and the flatteries of the court
which had brought him to the shameful end which had overtaken him. Had he
obeyed the lessons of that gospel which he had so often read, he said he
should not have fallen so far; it was worth more to be a good doer than a
good reader. Finally, he forgave those who had adjudged him to die, and he
desired them to pray God for his soul."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anne Boleyn confesses to Cranmer that she has never been
lawfully married to the king.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
The queen was left till a further mystery had perplexed yet deeper the
disgraceful exposure. Henry had desired Cranmer to be her confessor. The
archbishop was with her on the day after her trial,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> and she then made
an extraordinary avowal,<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> either that she had been married or
contracted in early life, or had been entangled in some connexion which
invalidated her marriage with the king. The letter to the emperor, which I
have already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> furnishes the solitary explanation of the mystery
which remains. Some one, apparently the imperial ambassador, informed
Charles that she was discovered to have been nine years before married to
Lord Percy, not formally only, but really and completely. If this be true,
her fate need scarcely excite further sympathy.</p>

<p>On Wednesday she was taken to Lambeth, where she made her confession in
form, and the archbishop, sitting judicially, pronounced her marriage with
the king to have been null and void. The supposition, that this business
was a freak of caprice or passion, is too puerile to be considered. It is
certain that she acknowledged something; and it is certain also that Lord
Northumberland was examined upon the subject before the archbishop. In
person upon oath indeed, and also in, a letter to Cromwell, Northumberland
denied that he had ever been legally connected with her; but perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
Northumberland was afraid to make an admission so dangerous to himself, or
perhaps the confession itself was a vague effort which she made to save her
<span class="sidenote">The queen is pronounced divorced.</span>
life.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
But whatever she said, and whether she spoke truth or falsehood,
she was pronounced divorced, and the divorce did not save her.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Friday,
the 19th, was fixed for her death; and when she found that there was no
hope she recovered her spirits. The last scene was to be on the green
inside the Tower. The public were to be admitted; but Kingston suggested
that to avoid a crowd it was desirable not to fix the hour, since it was
supposed that she would make no further confession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thursday, May 18. Kingston's tribute to her conduct in the

<p>"This morning she sent for me," he added, "that I might be with her at such
time as she received the good Lord, to the intent that I should hear her
speak as touching her innocency always to be clear. 'Mr. Kingston,' she
said, 'I hear say I shall not die afore noon, and I am very sorry
therefore, for I thought to be dead by this time, and past my pain.' I told
her it should be no pain, it was so subtle; and then she said, 'I heard say
the executioner was very good, and I have a little neck,' and put her hands
about it, laughing heartily. I have seen many men, and also women,
executed, and they have been in great sorrow; and to my knowledge, this
lady hath much joy and pleasure in death."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Friday, May 19. Tower Green at noon.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
We are very near the termination of the tragedy. A little before noon on
the 19th of May, Anne Boleyn, Queen of England, was led down to the green.
A single cannon stood loaded on the battlements; the motionless cannoneer
was ready, with smoking linstock, to tell London that all was over. The
yeomen of the guard were there, and a crowd of citizens; the lord mayor in
his robes, the deputies of the guilds, the sheriffs, and the aldermen; they
were come to see a spectacle which England had never seen before&mdash;a head
which had worn the crown falling under the sword of an executioner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The scaffold, and the persons present upon it.</div>

<p>On the scaffold, by the king's desire, there were present Cromwell, the
Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Suffolk, and lastly, the Duke of Richmond, who
might now, when both his sisters were illegitimized, be considered heir
presumptive to the throne. As in the choice of the commission, as in the
conduct of the trial, as in the summons of parliament, as in every detail
through which the cause was passed, Henry had shown outwardly but one
desire to do all which the most strict equity prescribed, so around this
last scene he had placed those who were nearest in blood to himself, and
nearest in rank to the crown. If she who was to suffer was falling under a
forged charge, he acted his part with horrible completeness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The queen's last words.</div>

<p>The queen appeared walking feebly, supported by the Lieutenant of the
Tower. She seemed half stupified and looked back from time to time at the
ladies by whom she was followed. On reaching the platform, she asked if she
might say a few words;<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and permission being granted, she turned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
the spectators and said: "Christian people, I am come to die. And according
to law, and by law, I am judged to death; and therefore I will speak
nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak
anything of that whereof I am accused and condemned to die. But I pray God
save the king, and send him long to reign over you; for a gentler and more
merciful prince was there never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle,
and sovereign lord. If any person will meddle of my cause, I require him to
judge the best. And thus I take my leave of the world and of you; and I
heartily desire you all to pray for me. Oh, Lord, have mercy on me. To God
I commend my soul."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> "These words," says Stow, "she spoke with a
smiling countenance." She wore an ermine cloak which was then taken off.
She herself removed her headdress, and one of her attendants gave her a cap
into which she gathered her hair. She then knelt, and breathing faintly a
commendation of her soul to Christ, the executioner with a single blow
struck off her head. A white handkerchief was thrown over it as it fell,
and one of the ladies took it up and carried it away. The other women
lifted the body and bore it into the Chapel of the Tower, where it was
buried in the choir.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>Thus she too died without denying the crime for which she suffered. Smeton
confessed from the first. Brereton, Weston, Rochfort, virtually confessed
on the scaffold. Norris said nothing. Of all the sufferers not one ventured
to declare that he or she was innocent,&mdash;and that six human beings should
leave the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span> world with the undeserved stain of so odious a charge on them,
without attempting to clear themselves, is credible only to those who form
opinions by their wills, and believe or disbelieve as they choose.</p>

<p>To this end the queen had come at last, and silence is the best comment
which charity has to offer upon it. Better far it would have been if the
dust had been allowed to settle down over the grave of Anne Boleyn, and her
remembrance buried in forgetfulness. Strange it is that a spot which ought
to have been sacred to pity, should have been made the arena for the blind
wrestling of controversial duellists. Blind, I call it; for there has been
little clearness of judgment, little even of common prudence in the choice
of sides. If the Catholics could have fastened the stain of murder on the
king and the statesmen of England, they would have struck the faith of the
establishment a harder blow than by a poor tale of scandal against a weak,
erring, suffering woman: and the Protestants, in mistaken generosity, have
courted an infamy for the names of those to whom they owe their being,
which, staining the fountain, must stain for ever the stream which flows
from it. It has been no pleasure to me to rake among the evil memories of
the past, to prove a human being sinful whom the world has ruled to have
been innocent. Let the blame rest with those who have forced upon our
history the alternative of a reassertion of the truth, or the shame of
noble names which have not deserved it at our hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh perplexity in the succession.</div>

<p>No sooner had the result of the trial appeared to be certain, than the
prospects of the succession to the throne were seen to be more perplexed
than ever. The prince so earnestly longed for had not been born. The
disgrace of Anne Boleyn, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span> before her last confession, strengthened the
friends of the Princess Mary. Elizabeth, the child of a doubtful marriage
which had terminated in adultery and incest, would have had slight chance
of being maintained, even if her birth had suffered no further stain; and
<span class="sidenote">Elizabeth now illegitimate.</span>
by the Lambeth sentence she was literally and legally illegitimate. The
King of Scotland was now the nearest heir; and next to him stood Lady
Margaret Douglas, his sister, who had been born in England, and was
therefore looked upon with better favour by the people. As if to make
<span class="sidenote">Lord Thomas Howard and Lady Margaret Douglas.</span>
confusion worse confounded, in the midst of the uncertainty Lord Thomas
Howard, taking advantage of the moment, and, as the act or his attainder
says,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> "being seduced by the devil, and not having the fear of God
before his eyes," persuaded this lady into a contract of marriage with him;
"The presumption being," says the same act, "that he aspired to the crown
by reason of so high a marriage; or, at least, to the making division for
the same; having a firm hope and trust <i>that the subjects of this
realm<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> would incline and bear affection to the said Lady Margaret,
being born in this realm; and not to the King of Scots, her brother, to
whom this realm hath not, nor ever had, any affection; but would resist his
attempt to the crown of this realm to the uttermost of their powers</i>."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The council and the peers urge the king to an instant
re-marriage.</div>

<p>Before the discovery of this proceeding, but in anticipation of inevitable
intrigues of the kind, the privy council and the peers, on the same grounds
which had before led them to favour the divorce from Catherine, petitioned
the king to save the country from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span> perils which menaced it, and to take
a fresh wife without an hour's delay. Henry's experience of matrimony had
been so discouraging, that they feared he might be reluctant to venture
upon it again. Nevertheless, for his country's sake, they trusted that he
would not refuse.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He marries Jane Seymour.</div>

<p>Henry, professedly in obedience to this request, was married, immediately
after the execution, to Jane, daughter of Sir John Seymour. The indecent
haste is usually considered a proof entirely conclusive of the cause of
Anne Boleyn's ruin.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Under any aspect it was an extraordinary step,
which requires to be gravely considered. Henry, who waited seven years for
Anne Boleyn, to whom he was violently attached, was not without control
over his passions; and if appetite had been the moving influence with him,
he would scarcely, with the eyes of all the world upon him, have passed so
extravagant an insult upon the nation of which he was the sovereign. If
Jane Seymour had really been the object of a pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>vious unlawful attachment,
her conduct in accepting so instantly a position so frightfully made
vacant, can scarcely be painted in too revolting colours. Yet Jane
Seymour's name, at home and abroad, by Catholic and Protestant, was alike
honoured and respected. Among all Henry's wives she stands out
distinguished by a stainless name, untarnished with the breath of reproach.</p>

<p>If we could conceive the English nation so tongue-tied that they dared not
whisper their feelings, there were Brussels, Paris, Rome, where the truth
could be told; yet, with the exception of a single passage in a letter of
Mary of Hungary,<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> there is no hint in the correspondence, either in
Paris, Simancas, or Brussels, that there was a suspicion of foul play. If
Charles or Francis had believed Henry really capable of so deep atrocity,
no political temptation would have induced either of them to commit their
cousins or nieces to the embrace of a monster, yet no sooner was Jane
Seymour dead, than we shall find them competing eagerly with each other to
secure his hand.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that when Anne Boleyn was growing licentious, the king
may have distinguished a lady of acknowledged excellence by some in no way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
improper preference, and that when desired by the council to choose a wife
immediately, he should have taken a person as unlike as possible to the one
who had disgraced him. This was the interpretation which was given to his
conduct by the Lords and Commons of England. In the absence of any
evidence, or shadow of evidence, that among contemporaries who had means of
knowing the truth, another judgment was passed upon it, the deliberate
assertion of an act of parliament must be considered a safer guide than
modern unsupported conjecture.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">June 8. Parliament meets.</div>

<p>This matter having been accomplished, the king returned to London to meet
parliament. The Houses assembled on the 8th of June; the peers had hastened
up in unusual numbers, as if sensible of the greatness of the occasion. The
Commons were untried and unknown; and if Anne Boleyn was an innocent
victim, no king of England was ever in so terrible a position as Henry
VIII. when he entered the Great Chamber fresh from his new bridal. He took
his seat upon the throne; and then Audeley, the Lord Chancellor, rose and
spoke:<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord Chancellor's speech at the opening.<br /><br />
The succession must be reconsidered.</div>

<p>"At the dissolution of the late parliament, the King's Highness had not
thought so soon to meet you here again. He has called you together now,
being moved thereunto by causes of grave moment, affecting both his own
person and the interests of the commonwealth. You will have again to
consider the succession to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span> crown of this realm. His Highness knows
himself to be but mortal, liable to fall sick, and to die.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> At present

life; and he is anxious to leave it, at his death, free from peril. He
desires you therefore to nominate some person as his heir apparent, who,
should it so befall him (which God forbid!) to depart out of this world
without children lawfully begotten, may rule in peace over this land, with
the consent and the good will of the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>"You will also deliberate upon the repeal of a certain act passed in the
late parliament, by which the realm is bound to obedience to the Lady Anne
Boleyn, late wife of the king, and the heirs lawfully begotten of them
twain, and which declares all persons who shall, by word or deed, have
offended against this lady or her offspring, to have incurred the penalties
of treason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord Chancellor's advice to the Houses.</div>

<p>"These are the causes for which you are assembled; and if you will be
advised by me, you will act in these matters according to the words of
Solomon, with whom our most gracious king may deservedly be compared. The
"wise man" counsels us to bear in mind such things as be past, to weigh
well such things as be present, and provide prudently for the things which
be to come. And you I would bid to remember, first, those sorrows and those
burdens which the King's Highness did endure on the occasion of his first
unlawful marriage&mdash;a marriage not only judged unlawful by the most famous
universities in Christendom, but so determined by the consent of this
realm; and to remember further the great perils which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span> have threatened his

found guilty of high treason, and has met the due reward of her
conspiracies. And then you will ask yourselves, what man of common
condition would not have been deterred by such calamities from venturing a
third time into the state of matrimony. Nevertheless, our most excellent
prince, not in any carnal concupiscence, but at the humble entreaty of his
nobility, hath consented once more to accept that condition, and has taken
to himself a wife who in age and form is deemed to be meet and apt for the
procreation of children.</p>

<p>"Lastly, according to the third injunction, let us now do our part in
providing for things to come. According to the desire of his most gracious
Highness, let us name some person to be his heir; who, in case (<i>quod
absit</i>) that he depart this life leaving no offspring lawfully begotten,
may be our lawful sovereign. But let us pray Almighty God that He will
graciously not leave our prince thus childless; and let us give Him thanks
for that He hath preserved his Highness to us out of so many dangers;
seeing that his Grace's care and efforts be directed only to the ruling his
subjects in peace and charity so long as his life endures, and to the
leaving us, when he shall come to die, in sure possession of these
blessings."</p>

<p>Three weeks after Anne Boleyn's death and the king's third marriage, the
chancellor dared to address the English legislature in these terms: and
either he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> spoke like a reasonable man, which he may have done, or else he
was making an exhibition of effrontery to be paralleled only by Seneca's
<span class="sidenote">The speech digested into a statute.</span>
letter to the Roman Senate after the murder of Agrippina. The legislature
adopted the first interpretation, and the heads of the speech were embodied
in an act of parliament. While the statute was in preparation, they made
use of the interval in continuing the business of the Reformation. They
abolished finally the protection of sanctuary in cases of felony, extending
the new provisions even to persons in holy orders:<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> they calmed the
alarms of Cranmer and the Protestants by re asserting the extinction of the
authority of the pope;<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
<span class="sidenote">July 1. Reassertion of the independence of the

and they passed various other laws of economic
and social moment. At length, on the 1st of July, in a crowded house,
composed of fourteen bishops,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> eighteen abbots, and thirty-nine lay
peers,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> a bill was read a first time of such importance that I must
quote at length its own most noticeable words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second great Act of Succession. The parliament endorse all the
proceedings in the late trials.</div>

<p>The preamble commenced with reciting those provisions of the late acts
which were no longer to remain in force. It then proceeded, in the form of
an address to the king, to adopt and endorse the divorce and the execution.
"Albeit," it ran, "most dread Sovereign Lord, that these acts were made, as
it was then thought, upon a pure, perfect, and clear foundation; your
Majesty's nobles and commons, thinking the said marriage then had between
your Highness and the Lady Anne in their consciences to have been pure,
sincere, perfect, and good, and so was reputed and taken in the realm;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
[yet] now of late God, of his infinite goodness, from whom no secret things
can be hid, hath caused to be brought to light evident and open knowledge
of certain just, true, and lawful impediments, unknown at the making of the
said acts; and since that time confessed by the Lady Anne, before the Most
Reverend Father in God, Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, sitting
judicially for the same; by the which it plainly appeareth that the said
marriage was never good, nor consonant to the laws, but utterly void and of
none effect; by reason whereof your Highness was and is lawfully divorced
from the bonds of the said marriage in the life of the said Lady Anne:</p>

<p>"And over this, most dread Lord, albeit that your Majesty, not knowing of
any lawful impediments, entered into the bonds of the said unlawful
marriage, and advanced the same Lady Anne to the honour of the sovereign
estate of the queen of this realm; yet she, nevertheless, inflamed with
pride and carnal desires of her body, putting apart the dread of God and
excellent benefits received of your Highness, confederated herself with
George Boleyn, late Lord Rochfort, her natural brother, Henry Norris, Esq.,
Francis Weston, Esq., William Brereton, Esq., gentlemen of your privy
chamber, and Mark Smeton, groom of your said privy chamber; and so being
confederate, she and they most traitorously committed and perpetrated
divers detestable and abominable treasons, to the fearful peril and danger
of your royal person, and to the utter loss, disherison, and desolation of
this realm, if God of his goodness had not in due time brought their said
treasons to light; for the which, being plainly and manifestly proved, they
were convict and attainted by due course and order of your common law of
this realm, and have suffered according to the merits:"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The late queen declared attainted.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
In consequence of these treasons, and to lend, if possible, further weight
to the sentence against her, the late queen was declared attainted by
authority of parliament, as she already was by the common law. The Act then
proceeded:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion of parliament upon the king's third marriage.</div>

<p>"And forasmuch, most gracious Sovereign, as it hath pleased your royal
Majesty&mdash;(notwithstanding the great intolerable perils and occasions which
your Highness hath suffered and sustained, as well by occasion of your
first unlawful marriage, as by occasion of your second); at the most humble
petition and intercession of us your nobles of this realm, for the ardent
love and fervent affection which your Highness beareth to the conservation
of the peace and amity of the same, and of the good and quiet governance
thereof, of your most excellent goodness to enter into marriage again; and
[forasmuch as you] have chosen and taken a right noble, virtuous, and
excellent lady, Queen Jane, to your true and lawful wife; who, for her
convenient years, excellent beauty, and pureness of flesh and blood, is apt
to conceive issue by your Highness; which marriage is so pure and sincere,
without spot, doubt, or impediment, that the issue presented under the
same, when it shall please Almighty God to send it, cannot be truly,
lawfully, nor justly interrupted or disturbed of the right and title in the
succession of your crown: May it now please your Majesty, for the
extinguishment of all doubts, and for the pure and perfect unity of us your
subjects, and all our posterities, that inasmuch as the marriage with the
Lady Catherine having been invalid, the issue of that marriage is therefore
illegitimate; and the marriage with the Lady Anne Boleyn having been upon
true and just causes deemed of no value nor effect, the issue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span> of this
marriage is also illegitimate; the succession to the throne be now
therefore determined to the issue of the marriage with Queen Jane."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The succession determined to the issue of the king by Queen
Jane.<br /><br />
A reason for demurring to the popular judgment in this matter.</div>

<p>Thus was every step which had been taken in this great matter deliberately
sanctioned<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> by parliament. The criminality of the queen was considered
to have been proved; the sentence upon her to have been just. The king was
thanked in the name of the nation for having made haste with the marriage
which has been regarded as the temptation to his crime. It is wholly
impossible to dismiss facts like these with a few contemptuous phrases; and
when I remember that the purity of Elizabeth is an open question among our
historians, although the foulest kennels must be swept to find the filth
with which to defile it; while Anne Boleyn is ruled to have been a saint,
notwithstanding the solemn verdict of the Lords and Commons, the clergy,
the council, judges, and juries, pronounced against her,&mdash;I feel that with
such a judgment caprice has had more to do than a just appreciation of
evidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The contingency to be provided for, of the last marriage proving
unfruitful.</div>

<p>The parliament had not yet, however, completed their work. It was possible,
as the lord chancellor had said, that the last marriage might prove
unfruitful, and this contingency was still unprovided for. The king had
desired the Lords and Commons to name his successor; they replied with an
act which showed the highest confidence in his patriotism; they conferred a
privilege upon him unknown to the constitution, yet a power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span> which, if
honestly exercised, offered by far the happiest solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Henry had three children. The Duke of Richmond was illegitimate in the
strictest sense, but he had been bred as a prince; and I have shown that,
in default of a legitimate heir, the king had thought of him as his
possible successor. Mary and Elizabeth were illegitimate also, according to
law and form; but the illegitimacy of neither the one nor the other could
be pressed to its literal consequences. They were the children, each of
them, of connexions which were held legal at the period of their birth.
They had each received the rank of a princess; and the instincts of justice
demanded that they should be allowed a place in the line of inheritance.
Yet, while this feeling was distinctly entertained, it was difficult to
give effect to it by statute, without a further complication of questions
already too complicated, and without provoking intrigue and jealousy in
other quarters. The Princess Mary also had not yet receded from the defiant
attitude which she had assumed. She had lent herself to conspiracy, she had
broken her allegiance, and had as yet made no submission. To her no favour
could be shown while she remained in this position; and it was equally
undesirable to give Elizabeth, under the altered circumstances, a permanent
preference to her sister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The parliament grant the king a power to bequeath the crown by
will.</div>

<p>The parliament, therefore, with as much boldness as good sense, cut the
knot, by granting Henry the power to bequeath the crown by will. He could
thus advance the Duke of Richmond, if Richmond's character as a man
fulfilled the promise of his youth; and he could rescue his daughters from
the consequences of their mother's misfor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>tunes or their mother's faults.
It was an expression of confidence, as honourable to the country as to the
king; and if we may believe, as the records say, that the tragedy of the
past month had indeed grieved and saddened Henry, the generous language in
which the legislature committed the future of the nation into his hands,
may have something soothed his wounds.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch as it standeth," they said, "in the only pleasure and will of
Almighty God, whether your Majesty shall have heirs begotten and procreated
from this (late) marriage, or else any lawful heirs or issues hereafter of
your own body, begotten by any other lawful wife; and if such heirs should
fail (as God defend), and no provision be made in your life who should rule
and govern this realm, then this realm, after your transitory life, shall
be destitute of a governor, or else percase [be] encumbered with a person
that would count to aspire to the same, whom the subjects of this realm
shall not find in their hearts to love, dread, and obediently serve<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> as
their sovereign lord; and if your Grace, before it be certainly known
whether ye shall have heirs or not, should suddenly name and declare any
person or persons to succeed after your decease, then it is to be doubted
<span class="sidenote">The reasons alleged for this measure.</span>
that such person so named might happen to take great heart and courage, and
by presumption fall to inobedience and rebellion; by occasion of which
premises, divisions and dissensions are likely to arise and spring in this

obedient servants, and all our posterities: For reformation and remedy
hereof, we, your most bounden and loving subjects, most obediently
acknowledging that your Majesty, prudently, victoriously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span> politicly, and
indifferently, hath maintained this realm in peace and quietness during all
the time of your most gracious reign, putting our trust and confidence in
your Highness, and nothing doubting but that your Majesty, if you should
fail of heirs lawfully begotten, for the love and affection that ye bear to
this realm, and for avoiding all the occasions of divisions afore
rehearsed, so earnestly mindeth the wealth of the same, that ye can best
and most prudently provide such a governour for us and this your realm, as
will succeed and follow in the just and right tract of all your
proceedings, and maintain, keep, and defend the same and all the laws and
ordinances established in your Grace's time for the wealth of the realm,
which we all desire, do therefore most humbly beseech your Highness, that
it may be enacted, for avoiding all ambiguities, doubts, and divisions,
that your Highness shall have full and plenary power and authority to
dispose, by your letters patent under your great seal, or else by your last
will made in writing, and signed with your hand, the imperial crown of this
realm, and all other the premises thereunto belonging, to such person or
persons as shall please your Highness.</p>

<p>"And we, your humble and obedient subjects, do faithfully promise to your
Majesty, by one common assent, that after your decease, we, our heirs and
successors, shall accept and take, love, dread, and only obey such person
or persons, male or female, as your Majesty shall give your imperial crown
unto; and wholly to stick to them as true and faithful subjects ought to
do."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

neither in this letter, nor in the other authentic papers connected with
her death, is there any allusion to Cardinal Pole's famous story, that
being on her deathbed, Queen Catherine prayed the king to allow her to see
her daughter for the last time, and that the request was refused. Pole was
not in England at the time. He drew his information from Catholic rumour,
as vindictive as it was credulous; and in the many letters from members of
the privy council to him which we possess, his narrative is treated as
throughout a mere wild collection of fables. I require some better evidence
to persuade me that this story is any truer than the rest, when we know
that Catherine allowed the king to hear that she was dying, not from
herself, but from a foreign ambassador; and that such a request could have
been made in the few days which intervened between this intimation and her
death, without some traces of it appearing in the close account which we
possess of her language and actions during those days, is in a high degree
unlikely.</p></div>

Arragon has provoked suspicion even where suspicion is unjust; and much
mistaken declamation has been wasted in connexion with this matter upon an
offence wholly imaginary.
</p><p>
In making her bequests, Catherine continued to regard herself as the king's
wife, in which capacity she professed to have no power to dispose of her
property. She left her legacies in the form of a petition to her husband.
She had named no executors; and being in the eyes of the law "a sole
woman," the administration lapsed in consequence to the nearest of kin, the
emperor. Some embarrassment was thus created, and the attorney-general was
obliged to evade the difficulty by a legal artifice, before the king could
take possession, and give effect to the bequests.&mdash;See Strype's <i>Memor.</i>,
Vol. I., Appendix, pp. 252-255. Miss Strickland's valuable volumes are so
generally read, that I venture to ask her to reconsider the passage which
she has written on this subject. The king's offences against Catherine
require no unnecessary exaggeration.</p></div>

denial, however, and was committed to the Tower. Afterwards, before the
council, he confessed. On his trial, his confession was read to him, and he
said he was deceived into making it by Sir W. Fitzwilliam: an accusation
against this gentleman very difficult to believe.</p></div>

suspected. He was absent from the court, and received a message from
Cromwell to appeal instantly on his allegiance. The following extract is
from the Deposition of the Abbot of Woburn&mdash;<i>MS. Cotton.</i> Cleopatra, E 4.:
</p><p>
"The said abbot remembereth that at the fall of Queen Anne, whom God
pardon, Master Bryan, being in the country, was suddenly sent for by the
Lord Privy Seal, as the said Master Bryan afterwards shewed me, charging
him upon his allegiance to come to him wheresoever he was within this realm
upon the sight of his letter, and so he did with all speed. And at his next
repair to Ampthill, I came to visit him there, at what time the Lord Grey
of Wilton, with many other men of worship, was with him in the great court
at Ampthill aforesaid. And at my coming in at the outer gate Master Bryan
perceived me, and of his much gentleness came towards meeting me; to whom I
said, 'Now welcome home and never so welcome.' He, astonished, said unto
me, 'Why so?' The said abbot said, 'Sir, I shall shew you that at leisure,'
and walked up into the great chamber with the men of worship. And after a
pause it pleased him to sit down upon a bench and willed me to sit by him,
and after that demanded of me what I meant when I said, 'Never so welcome
as then;' to whom I said thus: 'Sir, Almighty God in his first creation
made an order of angels, and among all made one principal, which was the
&mdash;&mdash;, who would not be content with his estate, but affected the celsitude
and rule of Creator, for the which he was divested from the altitude of
heaven into the profundity of hell into everlasting darkness, without
repair or return, with those that consented unto his pride. So it now
lately befell in this our worldly hierarchy of the court by the fall of
Queen Anne as a worldly Lucifer, not content with her estate to be true
unto her creator, making her his queen, but affected unlawful
concupiscence, fell suddenly out of that felicity wherein she was set,
irrecoverably with all those that consented unto her lust, whereof I am
glad that ye were never; and, therefore, now welcome and never so welcome,
here is the end of my tale.' And then he said unto me: 'Sir, indeed, as you
say, I was suddenly sent for, marvelling thereof and debating the matter in
my mind why this should be; at the last I considered and knew myself true
and clear in conscience unto my prince, and with all speed and without fear
[hastily set] me forward and came to my Lord Privy Seal, and after that to
the King's Grace, and nothing found in me, nor never shall be, but just and
true to my master the King's Grace.' And then I said 'Benedictus, but this
was a marvellous peremptory commandment,' said I, 'and would have
astonished the wisest man in this realm.' And he said, 'What then, he must
needs do his master's commandment, and I assure you there never was a man
wiser to order the king's causes than he is; I pray God save his life.'"
</p><p>
The language both of Sir Francis Bryan and the abbot is irreconcileable
with any other supposition, except that they at least were satisfied of the
queen's guilt.</p></div>

Meteren gives of these trials. His authority, a Flemish gentleman, was in
London at the time, but was not present in the court. The Lord of Milherve
(that was this gentleman's name) was persuaded that the queen was unjustly
accused, and he worked out of the rumours which he heard an interesting
picture, touched with natural sympathy. It has been often repeated,
however. It may be read elsewhere; and as an authority it is but of faint
importance. If we allow it its fullest weight, it proves that a foreigner
then in England believed the queen innocent, and that she defended herself
with an eloquence which deeply touched her hearers. His further assertion,
that "Smeton's confession was all which was alleged" against her, is
certainly inaccurate; and his complaint, which has been so often echoed, of
the absence of witnesses, implies only a want of knowledge of the forms
which were observed in trials for high treason. The witnesses were not
brought into court and confronted with the prisoner: their depositions were
taken on oath before the grand juries and the privy council, and on the
trial were read out for the accused to answer as they could.</p></div>

says that at first he and all other friends of the gospel were unable to
believe that the queen had behaved so abominably. "As I may be saved before
God," he says, "I could not believe it, afore I heard them speak at their
death." ... But on the scaffold, he adds, "In a manner all confessed but
Mr. Norris, who said almost nothing at all."</p></div>

Statutes of the Realm; 28 Henry VIII. cap. 7. Similarly, on the death of
Jane Seymour, the council urged immediate re-marriage on the king,
considering a single prince an insufficient security for the future. In a
letter of Cromwell's to the English ambassador at Paris, <i>on the day of
Jane Seymour's death</i>, there is the following passage:
</p><p>
"And forasmuch as, though his Majesty is not anything disposed to marry
again&mdash;albeit his Highness, God be thanked, taketh this chance as a man
that by reason with force overcometh his affections may take such an
extreme adventure&mdash;yet as sundry of his Grace's council here have thought
it meet for us to be most humble suitors to his Majesty to consider the
state of his realm, and to enter eftsoons into another matrimony: so his
tender zeal to us his subjects hath already so much overcome his Grace's
said disposition, and framed his mind both to be indifferent to the thing
and to the election of any person from any part that, with deliberation,
shall be thought meet for him, that we live in hope that his Grace will
again couple himself to our comforts."&mdash;<i>State Papers</i>, Vol. VIII. p. 1. </p></div>
